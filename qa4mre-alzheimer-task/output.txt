Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice . 
GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes ( Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on a real-time PCR machine ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype , AD neuropathology , sex and age by using a general linear model ( SPSS v. 18 ( IBM , Somers , NY ) ) . 
A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power . 
ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism : Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1 , Chiara Ciaccio1 , Diego Sbardella1 ,2 , Mariaserena Boraso3 , Barbara Viviani3 , Massimiliano Coletta1 ,2 , Stefano Marini1 * 1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences , University of Roma Tor Vergata , Roma , Italy , 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems , Bari , Italy , 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences , University of Milan , Milan , Italy 
Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) .

A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) .

Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity . 
Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression . 
( A ) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions . 
( B ) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 ( 92 kDa ) which is not modulated over each experimental condition . 
Analysis of - tubulin represents the internal control . 
The results presented are the means ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate , n = 9 . 
g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion . 
( A ) WB ( left panel ) and densitometric analysis of IDE ( right panel ) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide . 
( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants . 
Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A degradation . 
( A ) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein , compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool ( right panel ) . 
( B ) A ( 1 40 ) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level ( grey columns ) compared to IDE-silencing samples ( white columns ) . 
The results presented are the means ES of three independent experiments in triplicate . 
* Significantly different from internal control . 
+ Significantly different from silenced sample in the absence of somatostatin .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Alzheimer 's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified - Secretase Complexes

Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity . 
High-grade purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
Enzymatic activity of highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants . 
Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates .

Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h. Finally , cell culture medium was harvested , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000 rpm and frozen at 80 C until further processing . 
Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction . 
Total protein extracts were prepared in 1 % NP40 - HEPES buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000 g , 4 C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at 80 C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit ( Pierce ) . 
Multi-step purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1 ) Cell membrane preparation . 
MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells ( 1.0 109 cells ) expressing NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 , APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1 : wild type ( WT ) , or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues , were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer ( 50 mM MES , pH 6.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . 
Next , cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer ( Emulsiflex-C5 , Avestin Inc , ON Canada ) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi . 
Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min at 4 C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge . 
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C in a SW32 
Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet . 
The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer ( 0.1 M NaHCO3 , pH 11.3 ) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times , and incubated at 4 C for 20 min . 
The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C and stored at 80 C until use . 
3 ) Solubilisation of - secretase complexes . 
The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times . 
The membranes were then incubated at 4 C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material , the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4 C for 1 h , the pellet was discarded , and the supernatant saved . 
This lysate is defined as solubilised - secretase preparation . 
Next , these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of - secretase complexes as described below . 
4 ) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification . 
The solubilised - secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer , and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 150 mM NaCl ) ( final detergent concentration : 0.08 % CHAPSO , 0.08 % digitonin ) and incubated overnight at 4 C with agitation after adding 200 L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of Flag peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4 C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated M2 pooled 800 L fractions . 
5 ) Anti-V5 affinity purification . 
The M2 pooled fractions ( volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer ) were next incubated overnight at 4 C under agitation with 200 L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % digitonin-TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 g/mL of V5 peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated 4 times , and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated V5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions . 
As a final purification step , the V5 pooled fractions ( volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ) were next incubated overnight at 4 C under agitation with 200 L of anti-HA affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4 C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of HA peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once , for 1 h at 4 C , and the two eluted fractions were kept separately , designated HA fraction E1 and HA fraction E2 . 
Co-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts . 
Briefly , 100 g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors ( Roche ) , and 50 L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added . 
Samples were next incubated overnight at 4 C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer . 
Finally , beads were resuspended in 50 L of 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro - secretase assays .

Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice . 
GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes ( Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on a real-time PCR machine ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype , AD neuropathology , sex and age by using a general linear model ( SPSS v. 18 ( IBM , Somers , NY ) ) . 
A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power . 
ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism : Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1 , Chiara Ciaccio1 , Diego Sbardella1 ,2 , Mariaserena Boraso3 , Barbara Viviani3 , Massimiliano Coletta1 ,2 , Stefano Marini1 * 1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences , University of Roma Tor Vergata , Roma , Italy , 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems , Bari , Italy , 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences , University of Milan , Milan , Italy 
Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) . 
Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals , average ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate ( right panel ) . 
g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia , immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used . 
The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real 
A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) . 
Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells . 
( A ) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin ( white columns ) ; 24 hrs after incubation , the level is similar to the control ( grey columns ) . 
Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity .

g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion .

( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants . 
Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A degradation . 
( A ) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein , compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool ( right panel ) . 
( B ) A ( 1 40 ) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level ( grey columns ) compared to IDE-silencing samples ( white columns ) . 
The results presented are the means ES of three independent experiments in triplicate .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Alzheimer 's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified - Secretase Complexes

Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity . 
High-grade purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies .

Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained .

g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates . 
Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 , APH1aL-HA , wild-type PS1 human cDNAs ( PS1-WT ) were obtained from D. Selkoe ( Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston , MA , USA ) .

Replication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [ 61 ] . 
Briefly , cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70 % confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method , with 5 g of envelope plasmid ( pMD2G ) , 15 g of packaging plasmid ( psPAX2 ) , and 20 g of vector plasmids ( pSIN-PGK-WHV ) . 
Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates , washed twice with Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM , Invitrogen ) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM . 
After 24 h , the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled , passed through 0.45 m filter , and stored at 80 C as 2 mL aliquots until use . 
A p24 ELISA ( Zeptometrix corporation ) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated . 
Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductions 
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h.

MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells ( 1.0 109 cells ) expressing NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 , APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1 : wild type ( WT ) , or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues , were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer ( 50 mM MES , pH 6.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . 
Next , cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer ( Emulsiflex-C5 , Avestin Inc , ON Canada ) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi . 
Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min at 4 C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge . 
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C in a SW32 
Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet . 
The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer ( 0.1 M NaHCO3 , pH 11.3 ) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times , and incubated at 4 C for 20 min . 
The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C and stored at 80 C until use . 
3 ) Solubilisation of - secretase complexes . 
The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times . 
The membranes were then incubated at 4 C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material , the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4 C for 1 h , the pellet was discarded , and the supernatant saved . 
This lysate is defined as solubilised - secretase preparation . 
Next , these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of - secretase complexes as described below . 
4 ) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification . 
The solubilised - secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer , and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 150 mM NaCl ) ( final detergent concentration : 0.08 % CHAPSO , 0.08 % digitonin ) and incubated overnight at 4 C with agitation after adding 200 L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of Flag peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4 C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated M2 pooled 800 L fractions . 
5 ) Anti-V5 affinity purification . 
The M2 pooled fractions ( volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer ) were next incubated overnight at 4 C under agitation with 200 L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % digitonin-TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 g/mL of V5 peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated 4 times , and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated V5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions . 
As a final purification step , the V5 pooled fractions ( volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ) were next incubated overnight at 4 C under agitation with 200 L of anti-HA affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4 C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of HA peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once , for 1 h at 4 C , and the two eluted fractions were kept separately , designated HA fraction E1 and HA fraction E2 . 
Co-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts . 
Briefly , 100 g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors ( Roche ) , and 50 L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added . 
Samples were next incubated overnight at 4 C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer . 
Finally , beads were resuspended in 50 L of 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro - secretase assays .

Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice . 
GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes ( Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on a real-time PCR machine ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype , AD neuropathology , sex and age by using a general linear model ( SPSS v. 18 ( IBM , Somers , NY ) ) . 
A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power . 
ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism : Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1 , Chiara Ciaccio1 , Diego Sbardella1 ,2 , Mariaserena Boraso3 , Barbara Viviani3 , Massimiliano Coletta1 ,2 , Stefano Marini1 * 1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences , University of Roma Tor Vergata , Roma , Italy , 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems , Bari , Italy , 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences , University of Milan , Milan , Italy 
Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) . 
Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals , average ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate ( right panel ) . 
g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia , immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used . 
The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real 
A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) . 
Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells . 
( A ) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin ( white columns ) ; 24 hrs after incubation , the level is similar to the control ( grey columns ) . 
Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity . 
Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression . 
( A ) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions . 
( B ) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 ( 92 kDa ) which is not modulated over each experimental condition . 
Analysis of - tubulin represents the internal control . 
The results presented are the means ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate , n = 9 . 
g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion . 
( A ) WB ( left panel ) and densitometric analysis of IDE ( right panel ) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide . 
( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Alzheimer 's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified - Secretase Complexes

Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity . 
High-grade purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
Enzymatic activity of highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants . 
Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates . 
Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 , APH1aL-HA , wild-type PS1 human cDNAs ( PS1-WT ) were obtained from D. Selkoe ( Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston , MA , USA ) .

Replication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [ 61 ] . 
Briefly , cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70 % confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method , with 5 g of envelope plasmid ( pMD2G ) , 15 g of packaging plasmid ( psPAX2 ) , and 20 g of vector plasmids ( pSIN-PGK-WHV ) . 
Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates , washed twice with Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM , Invitrogen ) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM . 
After 24 h , the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled , passed through 0.45 m filter , and stored at 80 C as 2 mL aliquots until use . 
A p24 ELISA ( Zeptometrix corporation ) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated . 
Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductions 
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h. Finally , cell culture medium was harvested , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000 rpm and frozen at 80 C until further processing . 
Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction . 
Total protein extracts were prepared in 1 % NP40 - HEPES buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000 g , 4 C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at 80 C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit ( Pierce ) . 
Multi-step purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1 ) Cell membrane preparation . 
MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells ( 1.0 109 cells ) expressing NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 , APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1 : wild type ( WT ) , or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues , were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer ( 50 mM MES , pH 6.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . 
Next , cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer ( Emulsiflex-C5 , Avestin Inc , ON Canada ) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi . 
Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min at 4 C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge . 
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C in a SW32 
Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet . 
The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer ( 0.1 M NaHCO3 , pH 11.3 ) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times , and incubated at 4 C for 20 min . 
The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C and stored at 80 C until use . 
3 ) Solubilisation of - secretase complexes . 
The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times . 
The membranes were then incubated at 4 C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material , the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4 C for 1 h , the pellet was discarded , and the supernatant saved . 
This lysate is defined as solubilised - secretase preparation . 
Next , these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of - secretase complexes as described below . 
4 ) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification . 
The solubilised - secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer , and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 150 mM NaCl ) ( final detergent concentration : 0.08 % CHAPSO , 0.08 % digitonin ) and incubated overnight at 4 C with agitation after adding 200 L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of Flag peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4 C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated M2 pooled 800 L fractions .

Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice .

ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism : Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1 , Chiara Ciaccio1 , Diego Sbardella1 ,2 , Mariaserena Boraso3 , Barbara Viviani3 , Massimiliano Coletta1 ,2 , Stefano Marini1 * 1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences , University of Roma Tor Vergata , Roma , Italy , 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems , Bari , Italy , 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences , University of Milan , Milan , Italy 
Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) . 
Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals , average ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate ( right panel ) . 
g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia , immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used . 
The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real 
A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) . 
Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells . 
( A ) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin ( white columns ) ; 24 hrs after incubation , the level is similar to the control ( grey columns ) . 
Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity . 
Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression . 
( A ) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions . 
( B ) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 ( 92 kDa ) which is not modulated over each experimental condition . 
Analysis of - tubulin represents the internal control . 
The results presented are the means ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate , n = 9 . 
g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion . 
( A ) WB ( left panel ) and densitometric analysis of IDE ( right panel ) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide . 
( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants . 
Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A degradation . 
( A ) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein , compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool ( right panel ) . 
( B ) A ( 1 40 ) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level ( grey columns ) compared to IDE-silencing samples ( white columns ) . 
The results presented are the means ES of three independent experiments in triplicate .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Alzheimer 's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified - Secretase Complexes

Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity . 
High-grade purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
Enzymatic activity of highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants . 
Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates .

After 24 h , the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled , passed through 0.45 m filter , and stored at 80 C as 2 mL aliquots until use . 
A p24 ELISA ( Zeptometrix corporation ) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated . 
Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductions 
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h. Finally , cell culture medium was harvested , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000 rpm and frozen at 80 C until further processing . 
Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction . 
Total protein extracts were prepared in 1 % NP40 - HEPES buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000 g , 4 C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at 80 C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit ( Pierce ) . 
Multi-step purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1 ) Cell membrane preparation . 
MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells ( 1.0 109 cells ) expressing NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 , APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1 : wild type ( WT ) , or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues , were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer ( 50 mM MES , pH 6.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . 
Next , cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer ( Emulsiflex-C5 , Avestin Inc , ON Canada ) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi . 
Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min at 4 C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge . 
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C in a SW32 
Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet . 
The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer ( 0.1 M NaHCO3 , pH 11.3 ) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times , and incubated at 4 C for 20 min . 
The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C and stored at 80 C until use . 
3 ) Solubilisation of - secretase complexes . 
The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times . 
The membranes were then incubated at 4 C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material , the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4 C for 1 h , the pellet was discarded , and the supernatant saved . 
This lysate is defined as solubilised - secretase preparation . 
Next , these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of - secretase complexes as described below . 
4 ) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification . 
The solubilised - secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer , and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 150 mM NaCl ) ( final detergent concentration : 0.08 % CHAPSO , 0.08 % digitonin ) and incubated overnight at 4 C with agitation after adding 200 L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of Flag peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4 C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated M2 pooled 800 L fractions . 
5 ) Anti-V5 affinity purification . 
The M2 pooled fractions ( volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer ) were next incubated overnight at 4 C under agitation with 200 L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % digitonin-TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 g/mL of V5 peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated 4 times , and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated V5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions . 
As a final purification step , the V5 pooled fractions ( volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ) were next incubated overnight at 4 C under agitation with 200 L of anti-HA affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4 C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of HA peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once , for 1 h at 4 C , and the two eluted fractions were kept separately , designated HA fraction E1 and HA fraction E2 . 
Co-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts . 
Briefly , 100 g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors ( Roche ) , and 50 L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added . 
Samples were next incubated overnight at 4 C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer . 
Finally , beads were resuspended in 50 L of 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro - secretase assays . 
In vitro - secretase activity assays 
In vitro - secretase activity assays were performed as previously described [ 27 ] .

Characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing human FAD-linked PS1 variants in MEF PS1/2 / . 
Presenilin double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Two clones per PS1 variant were selected for characterization . 
( A ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with various antibodies to detect the endogenous - secretase core components : NCT ( NCT164 ) , hPS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ) , and PEN2 ( UD1 ) , and with an antibody for APP ( A8717 ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
( B ) - Secretase activity assays were performed with microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material .

Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice . 
GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes ( Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on a real-time PCR machine ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype , AD neuropathology , sex and age by using a general linear model ( SPSS v. 18 ( IBM , Somers , NY ) ) . 
A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power . 
ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) .

g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia , immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used . 
The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real 
A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) . 
Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells . 
( A ) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin ( white columns ) ; 24 hrs after incubation , the level is similar to the control ( grey columns ) . 
Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity . 
Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression . 
( A ) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions . 
( B ) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 ( 92 kDa ) which is not modulated over each experimental condition . 
Analysis of - tubulin represents the internal control . 
The results presented are the means ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate , n = 9 . 
g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion . 
( A ) WB ( left panel ) and densitometric analysis of IDE ( right panel ) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide . 
( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants . 
Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A degradation . 
( A ) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein , compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool ( right panel ) . 
( B ) A ( 1 40 ) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level ( grey columns ) compared to IDE-silencing samples ( white columns ) . 
The results presented are the means ES of three independent experiments in triplicate .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Alzheimer 's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified - Secretase Complexes

Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity .

( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies .

Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained .

g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates .

Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductions 
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h. Finally , cell culture medium was harvested , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000 rpm and frozen at 80 C until further processing .

Total protein extracts were prepared in 1 % NP40 - HEPES buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000 g , 4 C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at 80 C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit ( Pierce ) . 
Multi-step purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1 ) Cell membrane preparation .

3 ) Solubilisation of - secretase complexes . 
The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times .

Co-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts . 
Briefly , 100 g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors ( Roche ) , and 50 L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added . 
Samples were next incubated overnight at 4 C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer . 
Finally , beads were resuspended in 50 L of 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro - secretase assays .

Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice . 
GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes ( Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on a real-time PCR machine ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype , AD neuropathology , sex and age by using a general linear model ( SPSS v. 18 ( IBM , Somers , NY ) ) . 
A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power . 
ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) .

g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia , immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used . 
The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real 
A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) . 
Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells . 
( A ) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin ( white columns ) ; 24 hrs after incubation , the level is similar to the control ( grey columns ) . 
Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity . 
Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression . 
( A ) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions . 
( B ) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 ( 92 kDa ) which is not modulated over each experimental condition . 
Analysis of - tubulin represents the internal control . 
The results presented are the means ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate , n = 9 . 
g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion . 
( A ) WB ( left panel ) and densitometric analysis of IDE ( right panel ) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide . 
( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants . 
Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A degradation . 
( A ) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein , compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool ( right panel ) . 
( B ) A ( 1 40 ) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level ( grey columns ) compared to IDE-silencing samples ( white columns ) . 
The results presented are the means ES of three independent experiments in triplicate .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Alzheimer 's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified - Secretase Complexes

Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity . 
High-grade purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies .

Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars .

g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates .

After 24 h , the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled , passed through 0.45 m filter , and stored at 80 C as 2 mL aliquots until use . 
A p24 ELISA ( Zeptometrix corporation ) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated . 
Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductions 
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h. Finally , cell culture medium was harvested , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000 rpm and frozen at 80 C until further processing . 
Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction . 
Total protein extracts were prepared in 1 % NP40 - HEPES buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000 g , 4 C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at 80 C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit ( Pierce ) .

Next , cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer ( Emulsiflex-C5 , Avestin Inc , ON Canada ) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi . 
Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min at 4 C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge . 
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C in a SW32 
Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet .

3 ) Solubilisation of - secretase complexes . 
The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times .

This elution step was repeated once , for 1 h at 4 C , and the two eluted fractions were kept separately , designated HA fraction E1 and HA fraction E2 . 
Co-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts . 
Briefly , 100 g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors ( Roche ) , and 50 L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added . 
Samples were next incubated overnight at 4 C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer . 
Finally , beads were resuspended in 50 L of 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro - secretase assays .

Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice . 
GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes ( Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on a real-time PCR machine ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype , AD neuropathology , sex and age by using a general linear model ( SPSS v. 18 ( IBM , Somers , NY ) ) . 
A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power . 
ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) . 
Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals , average ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate ( right panel ) . 
g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia , immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used . 
The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real 
A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) . 
Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells . 
( A ) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin ( white columns ) ; 24 hrs after incubation , the level is similar to the control ( grey columns ) . 
Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity . 
Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression . 
( A ) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions . 
( B ) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 ( 92 kDa ) which is not modulated over each experimental condition . 
Analysis of - tubulin represents the internal control . 
The results presented are the means ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate , n = 9 . 
g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion . 
( A ) WB ( left panel ) and densitometric analysis of IDE ( right panel ) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide . 
( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants . 
Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A degradation . 
( A ) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein , compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool ( right panel ) . 
( B ) A ( 1 40 ) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level ( grey columns ) compared to IDE-silencing samples ( white columns ) . 
The results presented are the means ES of three independent experiments in triplicate . 
* Significantly different from internal control . 
+ Significantly different from silenced sample in the absence of somatostatin .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity . 
High-grade purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
Enzymatic activity of highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants . 
Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates .

Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductions 
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h.

Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice . 
GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes ( Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on a real-time PCR machine ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype , AD neuropathology , sex and age by using a general linear model ( SPSS v. 18 ( IBM , Somers , NY ) ) . 
A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power . 
ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism : Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1 , Chiara Ciaccio1 , Diego Sbardella1 ,2 , Mariaserena Boraso3 , Barbara Viviani3 , Massimiliano Coletta1 ,2 , Stefano Marini1 * 1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences , University of Roma Tor Vergata , Roma , Italy , 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems , Bari , Italy , 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences , University of Milan , Milan , Italy 
Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) . 
Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals , average ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate ( right panel ) . 
g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia , immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used . 
The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real 
A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) . 
Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells . 
( A ) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin ( white columns ) ; 24 hrs after incubation , the level is similar to the control ( grey columns ) . 
Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity . 
Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression . 
( A ) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions . 
( B ) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 ( 92 kDa ) which is not modulated over each experimental condition . 
Analysis of - tubulin represents the internal control . 
The results presented are the means ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate , n = 9 . 
g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion . 
( A ) WB ( left panel ) and densitometric analysis of IDE ( right panel ) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide . 
( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants . 
Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A degradation . 
( A ) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein , compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool ( right panel ) . 
( B ) A ( 1 40 ) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level ( grey columns ) compared to IDE-silencing samples ( white columns ) . 
The results presented are the means ES of three independent experiments in triplicate . 
* Significantly different from internal control . 
+ Significantly different from silenced sample in the absence of somatostatin .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Alzheimer 's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified - Secretase Complexes 
Matthias Cacquevel , Lor ne Aeschbach , Jemila Houacine , Patrick C. Fraering * cole Polytechnique F d rale de Lausanne , Brain Mind Institute , Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Alzheimer 's Disease , Lausanne , Switzerland 
Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity . 
High-grade purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
Enzymatic activity of highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants . 
Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates .

After 24 h , the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled , passed through 0.45 m filter , and stored at 80 C as 2 mL aliquots until use . 
A p24 ELISA ( Zeptometrix corporation ) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated . 
Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductions 
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h. Finally , cell culture medium was harvested , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000 rpm and frozen at 80 C until further processing .

Abstract Top The minor allele of rs11136000 within CLU is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) risk . 
The mechanism underlying this association is unclear . 
Here , we report that CLU1 and CLU2 are the two primary CLU isoforms in human brain ; CLU1 and CLU2 share exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 and proximal promoters . 
The expression of both CLU1 and CLU2 was increased in individuals with significant AD neuropathology . 
However , only CLU1 was associated with the rs11136000 genotype , with the minor protective rs11136000T allele being associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , we compared their expression ; for both CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells , clusterin is present in the secretory pathway , accumulates in the extracellular media , and is similar in size to clusterin in human brain . 
Overall , we interpret these results as indicating that the AD-protective minor rs11136000T allele is associated with increased CLU1 expression . 
Since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in AD , the AD-protection afforded by the rs11136000T allele may reflect increased soluble clusterin throughout life .

Introduction Top Clusterin ( CLU , APOJ ) has been implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ( reviewed in [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] ) . 
Although the primary role of clusterin in AD is unclear , CLU is implicated in AD by several lines of evidence , including ( I ) CLU mRNA and clusterin protein is increased in AD [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , ( ii ) clusterin is a component of plaques [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , ( iii ) clusterin modulates AD-related pathways such as inflammation and apoptosis [ 1 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and ( iv ) clusterin acts as an amyloid-beta ( A ) chaperone to alter A aggregation and/or clearance ( [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] ) . 
The physiologic relevance of CLU to AD was confirmed recently when CLU single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) s were associated with AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Overall , CLU genetic variation is essentially unequivocally associated with AD given the robust statistical power of the initial genome-wide association studies and subsequent replication studies [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] . 
Two CLU isoforms , CLU1 and CLU2 , have been reported that consist of nine exons and differ only in their first exons and associated proximal promoters ; CLU1 is predicted to encode a nuclear proteinand CLU2 a secreted protein ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
Additional reported isoforms include a CLU isoform that lacks exon 5 and a CLU isoform that lacks exon two , which encodes the leader sequence , resulting in another nuclear clusterin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Here , we investigated the hypothesis that CLU isoforms are differentially modulated by AD status and AD-associated SNPs . 
We identified CLU1 and CLU2 as the major CLU isoforms in human brain . 
Quantitative expression studies show that both CLU1 and CLU2 are increased in AD but only CLU1 is associated with rs11136000 . 
Lastly , although CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to produce intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively , immunofluorescence and Western blot studies indicate that CLU1 and CLU2 both produce secreted proteins that are similar to those detected in the human brain . 
Overall , we interpret our results as suggesting that SNP-mediated increases in secreted , soluble clusterin expression may act to reduce AD risk . 
The work described here was performed with approval from the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board . 
Cell CultureSH-SY5Y ( human neuroblastoma ) and HepG2 ( human hepatocellular carcinoma ) cells were maintained in Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a humidified 5 % CO2 - 95 % air atmosphere . 
Expression plasmids encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were generated from SH-SY5Y cellular mRNA that was reverse transcribed by using the primer 5 - TAGGTGCAAAAGCAACAT-3 which corresponds to sequence just after the CLU stop codon . 
CLU1 and CLU2 cDNAs were then amplified by PCR with forward primers 5 - TGAGTCATGCAGGTTTGCAG-3 ( CLU1 ) and 5 - ATGATGAAGACTCTGCTGCTG-3 ( CLU2 ) used in combination with the common reverse primer 5 - CTCCTCCCGGTGCTTTTTG-3 . 
Clones encoding CLU1 and CLU2 were detected by PCR screening and clone integrity confirmed by sequencing . 
De-identified human brain specimens were provided by the University of Kentucky AD Center Neuropathology Core [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
AD and non-AD designations followed NIARI neuropathology guidelines , which include indices of neuritic senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , and provide a likelihood staging of AD neuropathological diagnosis [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
Individuals with low AD neuropathology were cognitively intact prior to death and had no or low likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ; their average age at death was 81.8 10.2 ( mean SD , n = 17 ) . 
Individuals with high AD neuropathology represented a combination of demented individuals with high likelihood of AD by NIARI criteria ( n = 27 ) and cognitively intact individuals that were found to have moderate or high AD neuropathology at death ( n = 7 ) ; their average age at death was 81.9 6.2 ( mean SD , n = 34 ) . 
Fetal tissue RNA samples were obtained commercially ( Stratagene , Santa Clara , CA ) and have been described previously [ 27 ] . 
Total RNA was extracted from human brain specimens and converted to cDNA in 1 g aliquots with random hexamers and reverse transcriptase ( SuperScript III , Invitrogen ) , essentially as we described previously [ 24 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] . 
PCR primers were designed such that the splicing of each internal CLU exon as well as CLU1 and CLU2 were evaluated ( Table 1 ) . 
In initial screening , cDNA pooled from five high AD neuropathology and five low AD neuropathology samples were subjected to PCR-amplification ( Platinum Taq , Invitrogen ) by using each primer pair and a PCR profile consisting of initial denaturation for 5 minutes at 95 C , followed by 27 32 cycles of 94 C for 30 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 1 min , and final extension at 72 C for 7 min ( Perkin Elmer 9600 ) . 
PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , stained with SYBR Gold and visualized by using a fluorescence imager ( Fuji FLA-2000 ) . 
The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by direct sequencing ( Davis Sequencing , Davis , CA ) . 
PCR Primers for evaluating splice variation . 
t001 Real-time PCRThe expression level of CLU1 and CLU2 was quantified by real-time PCR . 
Each isoform was specifically amplified by using a sense primer corresponding to sequence within their respective exon 1 , i.e. , 5 - GCGAGCAGAGCGCTATAAAT-3 for CLU1 and 5 - AGATGGATTCGGTGTGAAGG-3 for CLU2 , and an antisense primer corresponding to sequence at the exon 2 3 boundary , i.e. , 5 - GACATTTCCTGGAGCTCATTG-3 . 
Note that the CLU1 sense primer contains the TATA sequence suggested by Schepeler et al to be present only in a longer CLU34 isoform [ 31 ] . 
The 20 l real-time PCR mixture containing approximately 20 ng of brain cDNA , 1 M of each primer and 1 Perfec 
Taq PCRSupermix ( Quanta Biosciences , Gaithersburg , MD ) was subjected to real-time PCR ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
PCR profiles consisted of pre-incubation at 95 C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s , 60 C for 30 s , and 72 C for 20 s. Specificity of the reactions was evaluated by showing a single PCR product by gel electrophoresis and by performing a melting curve analysis after PCR amplification . 
The PCR product copy number in each sample was determined relative to standard curves that were amplified in parallel and were based upon previously purified and quantified PCR products . 
The copy numbers were then normalized to the geometric mean of the copy numbers of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 and ribosomal protein L13A as described ( Vandesompele et al. , 2002 ; Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . 
All real-time PCR assays were repeated twice . 
GenotypingDNA samples were genotyped for rs11136000 by using unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan FAM and VIC dye-labeled MGB probes ( Pre-designed SNP Genotyping Assay , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) on a real-time PCR machine ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . 
Variation in CLU isoform expression were analyzed as a function of rs11136000 genotype , AD neuropathology , sex and age by using a general linear model ( SPSS v. 18 ( IBM , Somers , NY ) ) . 
A dominant mode of inheritance was assumed to maximize statistical power . 
ImmunofluorescenceCLU expression plasmids were transfected into SH-SY5Y cells by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences , Indianapolis , IN ) . 
Briefly , 3.75 104 cells/well were maintained in a poly-L-lysine treated 8-well chamber coverglass ( Lab-Tek , Nunc , Rochester , NY ) and transfected the next day with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 minutes . 
Non-specific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 % goat serum in PBS with 0.1 % Tween-20 ( PBST ) for 1 hour and the cells were then incubated with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab27671 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) and either rabbit anti-calnexin antibody ( 1:200 dilution , SPA-860 , Stressgen , Victoria , BC , Canada ) or rabbit anti-TGN46 antibody ( 1:1000 dilution , ab16052 , Abcam ) in 5 % goat serum at 4 C overnight . 
The next day , cells were washed with PBST three times and incubated with a mixture containing Alexa-488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) and Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody ( 1:200 dilution , Molecular Probes ) in 5 % goat serum at room temperature for an hour . 
After washing with PBST , cells were stained with 10 g/ml of Hoechst 33258 ( Molecular Probes ) for 30 minutes , washed with PBS , and subjected to fluorescence microscopy . 
Western BlotSH-SY5Y cells or HepG2 cells were grown in a 100 mm dish ( 2.6 106 cells/dish ) for 24 hours and then transfected with CLU1 or CLU2 expression plasmid by using FuGene HD Transfection Reagent as directed by the manufacturer ( Roche Applied Sciences ) . 
Twenty-four hours after transfection , cell medium was replaced with Opti-MEM ( Invitrogen ) and cells maintained for another 24 hours . 
The conditioned medium was collected and the cells washed with 5 ml of room-temperature PBS . 
Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant collected . 
Conditioned medium was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 minutes and 0.5 ml of the supernatant was collected and supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche Applied Science ) . 
Human brain anterior cingulate tissue samples were prepared by homogenizing ~ 0.5 mg tissue in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 protease inhibitor cocktail , centrifuging at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C , and then collecting the supernatant . 
After the protein concentration of each sample was determined ( Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , 15 or 20 g protein were mixed with SDS sample loading buffer containing - mercaptoethanol , boiled for 5 minutes and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7.5 % polyacrylamide gel . 
Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio-Rad ) . 
The blots were then incubated with 5 % nonfat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and probed overnight with mouse anti-V5 antibody ( 1:5000 dilution , Abcam ) or mouse anti-clusterin antibody ( 1:200 , B-5 Santa-Cruz ) at 4 C. After washing with PBST four times for 5 minutes each , the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody ( 1:1,000 dilution , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) for 1 hour at room temperature . 
Bound peroxidase was visualized by using a Super 
Signal West Pico kit ( Pierce ) and a molecular imager ( ChemiDoc XRS System , Bio-Rad ) . 
For studies involving PNGase F digestion , each protein sample was treated with PNGase F as directed by the manufacturer ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . 
Samples were then analyzed by Western blot as described above . 
Results Top To begin to evaluate CLU expression , we screened human brain cDNA to identify CLU isoforms present in brain . 
Previously reported isoforms include CLU1 and CLU2 , which are identical in exons 2 9 but differ in exon 1 , as well as isoforms lacking exons 2 or 5 ( [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
RT-PCR analyses of pooled human brain cDNA samples detected only CLU1 and CLU2 ( Figure 1A 1B ) . 
CLU2 translation is predicted to result in a secreted protein , beginning at the initial ATG in exon 2 that is common to both CLU2 and CLU1 ( Figure 1C ) . 
In contrast , CLU1 translation is predicted to initiate at an ATG within its exon 1 , which is in-frame with the ATG site in the common exon 2 . 
Hence , CLU1 is predicted to encode a protein identical to that encoded by CLU2 except that the CLU1 protein would contain 52 additional amino acids at its amino terminus ( Figure 1C ) . 
This change is predicted by PSORTII to result in an intracellular and likely nuclear , form of clusterin ( reviewed in [ 20 ] ) . 
In summary , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in brain and are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively . 
CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms expressed in human brain . 
The exon layout for the CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms is shown ( A ) . 
Coding and non-coding exonic regions are represented by black and white boxes , respectively , while introns are shown as thin black lines . 
The first ATG site in each isoform is shown as well . 
Evaluation of CLU splicing by RT-PCR identified only CLU1 and CLU2 in human brain cDNA ( B ) , i.e. , single PCR products are observed upon amplification from exon 1a exon 5 ( lane 1 ) , exon 1b exon 5 ( lane 2 ) , exon 4 exon 6 ( lane 3 ) and exon 5 exon 9 ( lane 4 ) . 
Molecular weight markers are shown at the left . 
The predicted protein sequences encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 , beginning with the initial ATG sites shown in A , are shown in panel C. The sequence in gray font is unique to CLU1 while sequence in black font is common to CLU1 and CLU2 . 
The boxed amino acid sequence represents signal sequence that is removed from clusterin-2 upon its translocation to the ER . 
Two nuclear localization sequences , as predicted by PSORT II ( http://psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.htm l ) , are underlined . 
The asterisk shows the clusterin cleavage site that separates the - and - subunits . 
g001 To evaluate whether rs11136000 , the primary AD-related CLU SNP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , is associated with CLU expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 expression in a series of brain samples . 
The CLU isoforms were quantified in separate real-time PCR assays that used forward primers corresponding to their unique exon 1 and a common reverse primer that targeted the exon 2 3 boundary . 
Copy numbers were determined relative to a standard curve for each isoform and normalized to the geometric mean of housekeeping genes [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
The expression of CLU1 and CLU2 were modestly coordinately regulated ( Figure 2A ) , with CLU2 being consistently greater than CLU1 ; the overall CLU2 : CLU1 ratio was 3.35 1.84 ( mean SD , n = 51 ) . 
To gain further insights into CLU isoform expression , we quantified CLU1 and CLU2 in a series of single human fetal tissue samples as well as a set of six adult choroid plexus samples ( Figure 2B ) . 
Among the fetal tissues , the CLU2 : CLU1 ratio varied widely from 0.3 ( skin ) to 6.2 ( kidney ) ( Figure 2B ) . 
The CLU2 : CLU1 ratio in choroid plexus , which produces cerebrospinal fluid , was 5.72 0.65 ( mean SD , n = 6 ) . 
Expression of CLU isoforms in human tissues . 
CLU1 and CLU2 isoforms were quantified by isoform-specific RT-PCR in a series of adult human cingulate and choroid plexus samples ( A B ) as well as a human fetal tissues ( B ) . 
Within A , each marker reflects the expression of CLU1 and CLU2 , normalized to housekeeping genes , in a single brain sample . 
Within B , the value in parentheses following the tissue name is the CLU1 : CLU2 ratio . 
CLU1 expression shows a positive association with AD neuropathology and rs11136000T allele ( C ) . 
CLU2 expression was increased in individuals with AD pathology and decreased with age ( D E ) . 
g002 We next evaluated CLU isoform expression as a function of AD neuropathology , rs11136000 status , sex and age . 
We found that CLU1 expression was significantly increased with high AD neuropathology and the minor rs11136000T allele ( Figure 2C , Table 2 ) . 
In contrast , CLU2 expression was significantly increased with AD neuropathology but not rs11136000 genotype , and decreased with age ( Figure 2D E , Table 3 ) . 
Overall , both CLU1 and CLU2 expression was increased with AD , confirming prior reports . 
However , only CLU1 expression was associated with rs11136000 . 
Since the minor rs11136000T allele was associated with both increased CLU1 expression and reduced AD risk [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , we interpret these results as suggesting that increased CLU1 expression is associated with reduced AD risk . 
t003 CLU1 and CLU2 are predicted to encode intracellular and secreted proteins , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . 
Therefore , we evaluated the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to discern whether these corresponded to the intracellular and secreted forms of clusterin that have been reported [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 33 ] . 
When each isoform was transiently transfected into neural SH-SY5Y cells , immunofluorescence analyses showed a similar subcellular localization pattern ( Figure 3 ) . 
The proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 tended toconcentrate within the Golgi apparatus , as established by double-labeling with an antibody against trans-Golgi network protein 46 ( TGN46 ) ( Figure 3A ) . 
Relatively modest amounts of clusterin were also detected within the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , as established by double labeling with calnexin ( Figure 3B ) . 
Nuclear , cytosolic , or mitochondrial-associated clusterin was not observed . 
Hence , the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 manifests an intracellular localization that includes the ER and Golgi , consistent with a possible secretory pathway for both proteins . 
CLU1 and CLU2 encoded proteins are localized to the ER and Golgi.SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with vectors encoding CLU1 and CLU2 ; the resultant clusterin expression was localized by a vector-derived V5 epitope tag . 
The subcellular localization for both proteins overlapped with the Golgi , as shown by co-labeling with antibody against TGN46 ( A ) and with the ER , as shown by co-labeling with an antibody against calnexin ( B ) . 
g003 CLU1 is predicted to encode a 501 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 57.8 kDa while CLU2 is predicted to encode 449 amino acids , totaling 52.5 kDa . 
During maturation of secreted clusterin , the protein is N-glycosylated and proteolyzed to generate a heterodimer that is maintained by disulfide bonds [ 20 ] . 
To compare the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 , we performed Western blot analyses of transfected SH-SY5Y cells ; ectopic clusterin was detected via a V5 epitope tag ( Figure 4 A B ) . 
Cell lysates contained both intact and cleaved clusterin while conditioned medium contained only cleaved clusterin ; the clusterin protein produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appeared equal in size ( Figure 4A ) . 
To discern whether glycosylation differences may obscure differences in the clusterin molecular weight derived from their primary sequence , the protein mixtures were digested with PNGase F to remove N-linked sugars prior to electrophoresis ; the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells were both decreased similarly by PNGase treatment ( Figure 4B ) . 
We considered the possibility that CLU translation may show cell-type specificity , and therefore repeated this study in an unrelated cell line by transfecting CLU1 and CLU2 into HepG2 cells . 
As with the SH-SY5Y cells , CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells produced clusterin of similar size , even after PNGase F digestion ( Figure 4C ) . 
Hence , we found no evidence to suggest that the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 differ in cellular localization , size , glycosylation , or proteolytic cleavage . 
Rather , when these Western blot studies are considered in combination with the immunofluorescence studies , CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce equivalent proteins that are similarly translated , glycosylated , and cleaved as they pass through the ER and Golgi in the secretory pathway to the extracellular space . 
CLU1 and CLU2 produce clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Transfection of CLU1 and CLU2 resulted in proteins of similar size , appearing as both intact and cleaved clusterin in cell lysates and conditioned media ; the proteins resulting from CLU transfection were detected via their V5 epitope tag ( A B ) . 
PNGase F treatment prior to electrophoresis reduced the size of the proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 similarly ( B ) . 
The apparent doublet in the protein encoded by CLU1 at 37 kDa was variable between experiments and likely reflects incomplete glycosylation as the doublet collapsed to a single band after PNGase F digestion . 
Results similar to those depicted in B were obtained when CLU1 and CLU2 were transfected into HepG2 cells ( C ) . 
When transfected and endogenous clusterin proteins were detected with an antibody raised against a carboxyl-terminal clusterin epitope ( D E ) , intact clusterin from transfection ( T-labeled arrow ) was slightly larger than endogenous clusterin ( E-labeled arrow ) , reflecting the ~ 5.1 kDa V5 epitope and His tags in the ectopic clusterin ( D ) . 
The bands labeled Fragments are clusterin alpha subunits derived from variably glycosylated endogenous and transfected clusterin . 
Overall , the cellular clusterin proteins are similar in size to the human brain clusterin , as discerned for the intact and cleaved clusterin under reducing conditions ( D ) or as the heterodimeric clusterin under non-reducing conditions ( E ) . 
g004 To evaluate whether the clusterin proteins produced by CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to those produced in vivo , we compared ectopic clusterin with endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells and in human brain by Western blotting with a clusterin antibody . 
Endogenous clusterin in SH-SY5Y cells migrates at a slightly lower molecular weight than that resulting from CLU transfection , reflecting the 5.1 kDa V5/His tag encoded by the pcDNA3 .1 vector expressing transfected CLU ( Figure 4D ) . 
Importantly , this 5.1 kDa size difference between endogenous and transfected clusterin is similar to the size difference between the CLU1 and CLU2-predicted proteins , indicating that if the proteins encoded by CLU1 and CLU2 differed by 5 kDa , the proteins would be resolved easily under these experimental conditions . 
The endogenous SH-SY5Y clusterin migrates similarly to the intact protein detected in brain homogenates suggesting these cellular forms are similar to those present in vivo ( Figure 4D ) . 
To extend this analysis to the heterodimeric form of clusterin , we also performed electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions . 
We found that heterodimeric protein from CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells appeared similar in size to each other and to the forms found in brain ( Figure 4E ) . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce proteins in vitro that are similar in size to endogenous clusterin in vitro and human brain . 
Discussion Top The main findings of this report are several . 
First , CLU1 and CLU2 are the primary CLU isoforms in human brain and differ in their first exon and proximal promoter . 
Second , the expression of only CLU1 was associated with rs11136000 while both CLU1 and CLU2 were increased with robust AD neuropathology . 
Third , CLU1 and CLU2 produce secreted clusterin proteins that are similar to each other and to clusterin in human brain . 
Since CLU is increased in AD and CLU1 is increased with the minor rs11136000T allele , which is also associated with reduced AD risk , we interpret our results as suggesting that increased CLU expression throughout life may reduce AD risk . 
Overall , these results identify a possible means underlying the association of rs11136000 with AD risk . 
The association between CLU expression and rs11136000 was discerned because the CLU isoforms were analyzed separately . 
For example , when we analyzed total CLU expression in the same fashion as reported here , total CLU was not associated with rs11136000 ( p = 0.51 ) although a robust association with AD pathology was observed ( p = 0.005 , Ling et al. , unpublished observations ) . 
The lack of a significant association between rs11136000 and total CLU is somewhat disconcerting since CLU1 and CLU2 appear to produce a similar protein . 
We speculate that ( i ) the threshold for clusterin biological significance may be less than the threshold for overall CLU statistical significance and/or ( ii ) CLU1 may be enriched in a cell type different than CLU2 , which may affect its functionality . 
We note that the lack of an association between total CLU and rs11136000 was similar to prior reports that total CLU mRNA or clusterin protein were not associated with rs11136000 [ 17 ] , [ 34 ] . 
As the clusterin produced by CLU1 and CLU2 appears similar , discerning an association between rs11136000 and clusterin would be especially challenging in tissues with a large proportion of CLU2 . 
In this regard , CLU2 was the major isoform in choroid plexus , suggesting that an association between cerebrospinal fluid clusterin and rs11136000 would be difficult to detect . 
The differential regulation of CLU1 and CLU2 was not unexpected because CLU1 and CLU2 have separate proximal promoter regions . 
Consistent with this observation , Cochrane etal found that androgen-treatment in a prostate cancer cell line decreased CLU1 expression while enhancing CLU2 expression [ 35 ] . 
Although the identification of the functional SNPs and transcription factors that modulate CLU expression is beyond the scope of this report , we note that rs11136000 resides within intron 3 and is common to both CLU1 and CLU2 . 
Hence , rs11136000 is likely not functional but rather is in linkage with a functional SNP more proximal to the CLU1 promoter . 
In summary , the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 was dependent upon analyzing the two CLU isoforms separately . 
Since earlier predictions were that CLU2 encodes a secreted protein while the additional 52 amino-terminal residues encoded by CLU1 would result in its intracellular localization [ 20 ] , we expected clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells to differ in cellular locale and size . 
In support of this prediction , the ATG translation initiation sites in the CLU1-specific exon 1a as well as the common exon 2 both satisfy Kozak consensus sequence requirements ( http://bioinfo.iitk.ac.in/AUGPred/ ) . 
However , clusterin in CLU1 and CLU2 transfected cells was localized to the secretory pathway and was equivalent in size under conditions that would easily discern their predicted five kDa size difference , especially after PNGase F treatment to remove sugar residues . 
Hence , CLU1 and CLU2 produce similar secreted proteins in vitro . 
Comparable results were obtained in two cell types , suggesting that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce soluble clusterin protein . 
The most parsimonious interpretation of these data is that CLU1 translation is generally initiated at the common exon 2 ATG . 
The possibility exists that a portion of CLU1 translation is initiated at the exon 1a ATG at levels too low to be readily detected or that produce an unstable protein which is rapidly degraded . 
Distinguishing among these possibilities is a future direction for this work . 
Overall , we summarize our current results by noting that the proteins produced from CLU1 and CLU2 in vitro are similar to each other , and similar in size to those present in human brain , leading us to interpret our data as supporting the possibility that CLU1 and CLU2 generally produce secreted clusterin protein in vitro and in vivo . 
A logical extension of the finding that AD risk is reduced with a genetic variant that correlates with increased CLU expression is that other factors that increase CLU expression may also reduce AD risk . 
Furthermore , since CLU expression is increased in AD without reversing the disease , we speculate that enhanced CLU expression reduces AD risk only if CLU expression is increased well before AD onset , mimicking the likely SNP effects . 
One possible modulator of interest is age-dependent changes in sex hormones since CLU isoforms are differentially regulated by androgens [ 35 ] . 
Stress has also been shown to upregulate CLU in many instances [ 36 ] and may cause the AD-associated increase in CLU observed here . 
In terms of possible therapeutic agents , multiple histone deacetylase inhibitors increase CLU expression robustly in vitro [ 37 ] . 
Interestingly , one member of this class , valproate , increases CLU expression in human astrocytes [ 37 ] and reduces amyloid accumulation as well as behavioral deficits in mouse amyloid models [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . 
While valproate may also act via other mechanisms [ 38 ] , the actions of valproate on CLU expression may be relevant to its neuroprotection and merit further exploration to reduce AD risk . 
Limitations of this study include that rs11136000 and AD neuropathological status capture only ~ 20 % of the variance in CLU expression . 
Identifying the unknown factors that account for the additional variance , which could include epigenetic factors , will facilitate understanding of CLU expression . 
Moreover , variability in these factors could facilitate or obscure the SNP association with CLU1 expression described here , suggesting that replication of these data in additional samples is necessary for their acceptance by the research community . 
Additionally , since the nuclear form of clusterin arising from an isoform lacking exon 2 has been associated with apoptosis [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , this isoform may be transiently expressed and hence below our limits of detection , especially in comparison with CLU1 and CLU2 . 
In conclusion , the AD-protective allele of rs11136000 was associated with increased expression of CLU1 but not CLU2 in our dataset . 
Both CLU1 and CLU2 produce a soluble , secreted clusterin protein that is similar to that observed in human brain . 
Discerning the association between rs11136000 and CLU1 depended upon analyzing these two CLU isoforms separately .

Somatostatin Modulates Insulin-Degrading-Enzyme Metabolism : Implications for the Regulation of Microglia Activity in ADGrazia Tundo1 , Chiara Ciaccio1 , Diego Sbardella1 ,2 , Mariaserena Boraso3 , Barbara Viviani3 , Massimiliano Coletta1 ,2 , Stefano Marini1 * 1 Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences , University of Roma Tor Vergata , Roma , Italy , 2 Interuniversity Consortium for the Research on the Chemistry of Metals in Biological Systems , Bari , Italy , 3 Department of Pharmacological Sciences , University of Milan , Milan , Italy 
Abstract Top The deposition of - amyloid ( A ) into senile plaques and the impairment of somatostatin-mediated neurotransmission are key pathological events in the onset of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . 
Insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) is one of the main extracellular protease targeting A , and thus it represents an interesting pharmacological target for AD therapy . 
We show that the active form of somatostatin-14 regulates IDE activity by affecting its expression and secretion in microglia cells . 
A similar effect can also be observed when adding octreotide . 
Following a previous observation where somatostatin directly interacts with IDE , here we demonstrate that somatostatin regulates A catabolism by modulating IDE proteolytic activity in IDE gene-silencing experiments . 
As a whole , these data indicate the relevant role played by somatostatin and , potentially , by analogue octreotide , in preventing A accumulation by partially restoring IDE activity .

Introduction Top The development of an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) requires a deeper understanding of the biochemical mechanism which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death [ 1 ] . 
Although molecular basis of AD remains largely unclear , there is considerable evidence which supports the so-called amyloid cascade hypothesis : AD may be viewed as a metabolic vicious cycle in which - amyloid ( A ) deposition into senile plaques drives neurodegeneration by triggering abnormal microglia activation , tau protein hyperphosphorylation and the consequent death of astrocytes and neurons . 
A accumulation in the brain is the result of the imbalance between its biosynthesis and removal [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . 
Several proteases , such as insulin-degrading-enzyme ( IDE ) , neprilysin ( NEP ) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP-9 ) are involved in A degradation [ 4 ] [ 6 ] . 
In this regard , a decrease in A - degrading enzymes expression or activity , as a result of genetic factors , age and environmental conditions , may be a crucial aspect in AD pathogenesis [ 7 ] . 
Notably , IDE is a zinc metalloendopeptidase that hydrolyzes a wide range of substrates , including insulin , amylin , glucagon , atrial natriuretic factor and insulin-like growth factors I and II [ 8 ] . 
Even though its role in the onset of AD is not yet to be completely understood [ 5 ] , the relevance of IDE in AD pathogenesis has been validated in works which have mapped the IDE gene on chromosome 10 [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , making it a candidate gene for the AD-6 locus . 
Furthermore , it has been shown that , during aging , IDE decreases in the brain of AD patients [ 11 ] [ 13 ] . 
Additionally , several studies underline a link between IDE haplotypes and SNPs in the IDE gene , associating them to AD [ 14 ] [ 16 ] . 
We have recently demonstrated that somatostatin ( sst ) is a substrate and an allosteric modulator of IDE activity , which enhances the proteolytic processing of a synthetic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Somatostatin depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients is directly connected to memory and learning impairment [ 18 ] [ 20 ] and a strong reduction of sst-expressing neurons in the mouse CA1 hippocampal region seems to be associated to the onset of AD [ 21 ] . 
Somatostatin seems to be also involved in the regulation of neprilysin activity by affecting its expression and its synaptic localization [ 22 ] . 
Although molecular mechanisms coupling somatostatin depletion and AD remain unclear , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been identified as a potential pharmacological strategy for AD prevention [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] . 
Furthermore , the activation of somatostatin neurotransmission by sst-releasing agents , such as FK960 and FK962 , has been shown to significantly improve cognitive performances in animal models [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] . 
On the other hand , although in the past , the use of the somatostatin analogue octreotide in clinical trials has not been unequivocally associated to the restoration of cognitive functions , there is some evidence which seems to demonstrate its potential therapeutic value [ 24 ] , [ 27 ] . 
Since microglia secretes A and IDE [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] and displays three functionally active receptor subtypes for somatostatin ( sst ) ( i.e. Receptors type 2 , 3 and 4 ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , we investigated sst effect on IDE expression in microglia cells . 
In this work , we show that in activated microglia , somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and proteolytic activity toward A , which suggests that somatostatin pathological depletion could be one of the key events leading to A deposition .

Results Top Somatostatin modulation of IDE expressionBV-2 cells as well as primary rat microgliawere stimulated with different sst concentrations and the IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of incubation . 
Since sst half life in the serum is short [ 36 ] , the same sst concentration was re-added 6 hrs after the first administration . 
This addition further amplifies the positive modulation of IDE expression ( Figure 1 ) . 
It is interesting to note that WB analysis on cell lysates of sst-stimulated N9 microglia cell line confirms the enhancing effect on IDE expression ( data not shown ) . 
In order to assess whether the effect of sst on IDE expression is a microglia characteristic , rat astrocytes which display three sst receptor subtypes as well ( SSTR-1 , SSTR-2 , and SSTR-4 ) [ 37 ] were incubated with the same somatostatin concentrations ( Figure S1 ) . 
IDE level was analyzed by Western blotting in cell lysates collected after 24 hrs of sst incubation and as indicated in Figure S1 , no detectable modulation of IDE expression was observed . 
Somatostatin induces an increase of IDE expression in microglia cells . 
Western blot analysis of normalized lysis samples from rat primary microglia ( A ) and BV-2 ( B ) indicates that IDE level increases after 24 hrs of somatostatin incubation , while the internal control - tubulin is constant . 
The additional incubation with sst after 6 hrs from first round strengthens the effect on IDE expression ( left panel ) . 
Densitometric analysis of IDE WB signals , average ES of 5 independent experiments in triplicate ( right panel ) . 
g001 Since there was no principle difference in the response to somatostatin in microglia cell lines compared to primary rat microglia , immortalized BV-2 cells were subsequently used . 
The sst-mediated up-regulation of IDE in BV-2 cells was further checked by quantifying the mRNA using a Real 
A time-course investigation reveals that IDE mRNA increases linearly with the sst concentration within 5 hrs to incubation and turns back after 24 hrs , suggesting a transcriptional effect triggered by sst in BV2 cells ( Figure 2A ) . 
Somatostatin modulation on IDE level in BV-2 cells . 
( A ) IDE mRNA increases after 5 hrs of incubation with somatostatin ( white columns ) ; 24 hrs after incubation , the level is similar to the control ( grey columns ) . 
Basal mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR in individual preparations of BV2 . 
Data were first normalized against GAPDH and then expressed setting the value measured in controls at 1 . 
The results presented are the means ES ( B ) Elisa analysis of conditioned medium indicates that IDE level increases in BV-2 cells after 24 hrs of incubation as a function of somatostatin concentration . 
The results presented are the means SEs of five independent experiments in triplicate . 
g002 Somatostatin effect on IDE secretion 
It is known that a small fraction of IDE ( ranging from 3 % to 10 % ) is secreted into the extracellular space , where it presumably interacts with its substrates , such as insulin and - amyloid [ 8 ] , [ 38 ] . 
In order to determine whether , besides inducing synthesis , sst also stimulates IDE secretion , the enzyme concentration in cell supernatants was quantified 24 hrs after sst administration . 
As reported in Figure 2B , the neuropeptide induces the increase of IDE secretion in a similar way to WB and RT-PCR ( Figue 1B and 2A ) . 
This result indicates that somatostatin acts not only by modulating IDE expression , but also by affecting IDE secretion and increasing the amount of the enzyme in the extracellular space . 
In addition to their ability to phagocyte - amyloid , microglia can also clear A by degradation through the production of A - degrading enzymes , such as IDE , neprilysin and MMP-9 [ 29 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 39 ] . 
Therefore , we assessed whether sst is involved in the regulationof MMP-9 level . 
For this purpose , BV-2 cells were stimulated with different sst concentrations and MMP-9 activity was measured by zymographyc analysis ( Figure 3A ) . 
No detectable modulation of MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity was observed for each experimental condition . 
Qualitative analysis of MMP-9 content was further performed on total cell lysates . 
A polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band around 92 kDa , corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 , which is constant over the different sst concentrations ( Figure 3B ) . 
This result rules out any involvement of sst in the modulation of MMP-9 expression , secretion and activity . 
Effect of somatostatin on MMP-9 expression . 
( A ) Zymographyc analysis of cell culture supernatants harvested after 24 hrs of incubation indicate that somatostain administration does not modulate gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 in each of the experimental conditions . 
( B ) In Western blotting analysis of cell lysates a polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody recognizes a single band corresponding to the pro-MMP-9 ( 92 kDa ) which is not modulated over each experimental condition . 
Analysis of - tubulin represents the internal control . 
The results presented are the means ES of three indipendent experiments in triplicate , n = 9 . 
g003 Octreotide modulation of IDE expression 
Recently , somatostatin transmitter replacement has been viewed as a potential AD therapeutical strategy [ 24 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this regard , BV-2 cells were stimulated with octreotide , a long-acting octapeptide somatostatin analogue commonly used in clinical trials , in order to verify the effect on the expression pattern of IDE [ 41 ] . 
0.1 10 M octreotide induces a dose-dependent increase of IDE expression ( Figure 4A ) in a similar way to what can be observed in the presence of somatostatin ( Figure 1 ) . 
A similar result can also be obtained for IDE secretion , by using an ELISA assay on BV-2 cell supernatants collected 24 hrs after the administration ( Figure 4B ) . 
Therefore , these findings indicate that octreotide and sst exert a very similar effect on IDE expression and secretion in BV-2 cells ( see Figures 1 , 2 and 4 ) . 
Somatostatin analogue octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion . 
( A ) WB ( left panel ) and densitometric analysis of IDE ( right panel ) after 24 hrs incubation with the indicated concentrations of octreotide . 
( B ) ELISA analysis on BV-2 medium after octreotide incubation reveals that the sst analogue induces IDE secretion . 
In every case , the results presented are the means ES of four independent experiments in triplicate . 
g004 Somatostatin regulation of A ( 1 40 ) degradation by insulin-degrading-enzyme 
We have previously shown that somatostatin is an IDE substrate and an allosteric modulator of recombinant IDE enzymatic activity toward a fluorogenic - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Therefore , we aimed to verify whether sst by allosteric modulation of endogenous IDE could affect the clearance of the A peptide secreted by BV-2 cells . 
To this purpose , IDE expression was silenced through a siRNA-based approach . 
At the maximum rate of IDE silencing ( corresponding to about 60 % 70 % , see Figure 5A ) , different somatostatin concentrations ( ranging between 0.01 M and 0.5 M ) were added to the culture medium of both silenced and non-silenced cells . 
A ( 1 40 ) was quantified in cell supernatants after 1 h of somatostatin stimulation , a time interval during which there was no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE , a fact that was demonstrated through Western Blotting analysis on cell lysates ( data not shown ) . 
A ( 1 40 ) concentration was slightly reduced at sst 0.01 M in both silenced and not-silenced cells . 
In spite of this , A ( 1 40 ) concentration was not further altered in the medium of silenced cells by increasing sst concentrations , while it was progressively reduced in the medium of non-silenced cells ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that the reduction of A observed at sst 0.01 in silenced cellscould be due to the effect of sst on residual IDE . 
Therefore , at physiological concentrations , sst modulates IDE activity also by promoting A ( 1 40 ) degradation in the BV-2 cells supernatants . 
Somatostatin regulates IDE activity enhancing IDE-dependent A degradation . 
( A ) BV-2 cells transfected with a specific IDE siRNA pool show reduced levels of IDE protein , compared to cells transfected with a nonspecific control siRNA pool ( right panel ) . 
( B ) A ( 1 40 ) quantification through sandwich ELISA reveals that the levels of A are drastically reduced in the presence of IDE steady level ( grey columns ) compared to IDE-silencing samples ( white columns ) . 
The results presented are the means ES of three independent experiments in triplicate . 
* Significantly different from internal control . 
+ Significantly different from silenced sample in the absence of somatostatin .

g005 Discussion Top Although several pathological mechanisms of AD progression have been described , ranging from protein aggregation to oxidative stress , mitochondrial failure , metal dyshomeostasis and microglia dysfunction , the important role of amyloid deposition is now widely recognized [ 7 ] . 
In this regard , the extracellular A degrading enzymes ( such as IDE , MMP-9 and NEP ) are now considered promising therapeutic targets for AD treatment [ 33 ] . 
Notably , IDE is the main extracellular protease secreted by microglia involved in A degradation , even though the molecular basis of IDE regulation are poorly known [ 5 ] . 
Microglia seems to cover a two-fold role in AD pathogenesis . 
Firstly , early microglia activation exerts a neuroprotective effect by promoting A clearance . 
Secondly , as the disease progresses , the microglia A - clearing capability is compromised [ 38 ] , [ 41 ] . 
This downregulation is followed by an increase of A released by neurons and by a worsening of the disease [ 32 ] . 
We previously demonstrated that sst is an allosteric modulator of IDE [ 17 ] . 
In this work , we further study the effect of sst on IDE showing that the neuropeptide somatostatin also specifically regulates IDE , the main extracellular A protease , by affecting its expression and secretion in both primary and BV-2 microglia cells . 
Somatostatin triggers IDE gene transcription and protein which displays a different turnover rate : IDE-mRNA reaches a maximum of transcription within 5 hrs after stimulation , returning to the basal level within 24 hrs , whereas the protein concentration increases in cell lysates and supernatants at later times , being still clearly evident after 24 hrs . 
Through this pathway , somatostatin enhances IDE secretion , strengthening the pool of active enzymes which interact with - amyloid and other IDE extracellular substrates . 
This effect is specific for IDE since sst does not affect either secretion and activity of MMP-9 , another enzyme which is active in A degradation . 
It is known that IDE and somatostatin levels are altered in AD progression [ 3 ] , [ 20 ] . 
It is thus conceivable that sst depletion results in a decrease of IDE expression and secretion contributing to the pathological deposition of - amyloid in the brain . 
In addition , since the A chronic accumulation triggers a further reduction in sst level [ 18 ] , all these events could represent a vicious cycle which ultimately favors A plaque formations . 
As matter of fact , somatostatinergic transmitter replacement is a potentially viable strategy in the treatment of AD , even though the pharmacological restoration of this deficit has not been unequivocally associated to a recovery of normal cognitive performances [ 24 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 40 ] . 
In this framework , we tested the octreotide effect on IDE expression , a somatostatin analogue currently used in the treatment of acromegaly , pituitary adenomes and pancreatic tumors [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] . 
Here , we show that , like somatostatin , octreotide increases IDE expression and secretion , although the effects are generally reduced compared to the endogenous modulator . 
Somatostatin binds all five receptor subtypes with high affinity , whereas octreotide is a selective agonist , binding to receptor subtypes 2 and 5 with high affinity ( but lower than somatostatin ) and with moderate affinity to subtype 3 [ 41 ] . 
Therefore , this evidence might explain the discrepancy between sst and its analogue concerning the positive modulation of IDE expression , even though additional factors can not be ruled out . 
Interestingly , we also observed that in astrocytes , incubation with somatostatin does not have any significant detectable effect of IDE expression , reinforcing the physiological relevance of somatostatin action on IDE secretion in microglia cells . 
In our previous work , we reported that somatostatin is an allosteric modulator of IDE enzymatic activity on a fluorogenic A - peptide [ 17 ] . 
Here , we show that somatostatin addition to the culture medium of BV-2 cells rapidly affects the amyloid - peptide ( 1 40 ) extracellular concentration : after 1 h of stimulation ( a time interval over which there is no accumulation of newly synthesized IDE ) , we observe a negative correlation between A concentration and sst concentration . 
The lack of similar evidence in supernatants from IDE-silenced cells suggests that the decrease in A levels is fully attributable to the modulation of IDE activity secreted before sst administration . 
As a whole , the reported data indicate that somatostatin regulates IDE expression , secretion and catalytic activity in microglia . 
These results are intriguing , considering that a microglia pharmacological manipulation is thought to play a neuroprotective role at least in the early stages of AD , since these cells cluster around senile plaques promoting A phagocytosis and degradation [ 3 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 43 ] . 
Therefore , a correlation can be envisaged between the regulation of IDE activity and the microglial immunological function during the development of AD , opening a new therapeutic scenario for the control of AD in the early phases .

Biochemical and morphological alterations of mitochondria may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer sdisease ( AD ) . 
Particularly , mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid-beta-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer s disease . 
The recent emphasis on the intracellular biology of amyloid-beta and its precursor protein ( APP ) has led researchers to consider the possibility that mitochondria-associated and mitochondrial amyloid-beta may directly cause neurotoxicity . 
Both proteins are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
In this paper , we will outline current knowledge of the intracellular localization of amyloid-beta . 
Moreover , we summarize evidence from AD postmortem brain as well as animal AD models showing that amyloid-beta triggers mitochondrial dysfunction through a number of pathways such as impairment of oxidative phosphorylation , elevation of reactive oxygen species production , alteration of mitochondrial dynamics , and interaction with mitochondrial proteins . 
Thus , this paper supports the Alzheimer cascade mitochondrial hypothesis such as the most important early events in this disease , and probably one of the future strategies on the therapy of this neurodegenerative disease . 
Each year , over 10 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases . 
This figure is expected to grow by 20 % over the next decade as the aging population increases and lives longer . 
This disease group is the fourth biggest killer in the developed world after heart diseases , cancer , and stroke [ 1 ] . 
The most common neurodegenerative diseases are AD , Parkinson disease , Lewy body dementia , frontotemporal dementia , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ 2 ] . 
The most widely recognized is AD , which is among the principal debilitating conditions of the current century . 
Approximately 24 million people worldwide suffer from dementia , 60 % of cases being due to AD , which occurs in 1 % of individuals aged 50 to 70 years old and dramatically increases to 50 % of those over 70 years old [ 3 ] . 
Dramatically , these numbers are estimated to increase to 15 million in the next 40 years [ 4 ] . 
From the neuropathological point of view , AD is characterized by selective neuronal loss , marked synaptic alteration , morphological mitochondrial abnormalities , and Tau pathology . 
The histological hallmark lesions of AD are characterized by senile plaques and cerebrovascular deposits . 
The extracellular amyloid plaques mainly composed of amyloid-beta and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles built up of hyperphosphorylated tau , although the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are still unknown and there is still no cure . 
Many lines of evidence suggest that oxidative stress is one of the earliest changes and plays an important role in the pathological process in AD , and more recently , energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD [ 1 11 ] . 
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and is intimately linked to aging , the best established risk factor for AD . 
Increased oxidative stress levels have been found in the brains of patients with AD in Sweden and early in Tg2576 APP transgenic mice [ 12 , 13 ] . 
Recently , we described that PLA2G3 gene silencing produced a marked inhibition of the free radical-generating xanthine/xanthine oxidase - ( X-XOD - ) system-induced cell death , and that PLA2G3 polymorphisms are associated with AD in a Spanish case-control sample [ 14 ] . 
In previous studies with choroid plexus homogenates with different cases with AD in the different stages ( I/0 , III-IV , and V-VI ) , we demonstrated that in AD patients , amyloid-beta peptide also accumulates in choroid plexus [ 15 ] , there is an oxidation of carboxymethyl-lysine ( CML ) , and N-carboxyethyl-lysine ( CEL ) may result in impaired protein interactions , protein folding , and protein kinase activity ; abnormal function of endothelialand vascular smooth muscle cells ; impaired HDL-cholesterol metabolism in the choroid plexus in advanced stages of AD [ 16 ] .2 . 
Mitochondria are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells and function to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by oxidative phosphorylation and are thought to be derived evolutionarily from the fusion of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms [ 17 ] . 
They are also involved in regulation of cell death via apoptosis , in the control of cell division and growth , in calcium homeostasis , haem biosynthesis , and in the formation and export of iron-sulphur clusters . 
Mitochondria are composed of a double lipid membrane which structures four compartments , distinct by composition and function ( Figure 1 ) . 
The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle . 
It contains many proteins like import complexes and voltage-dependent anion channels responsible for the free passage of low-molecular-weight substances ( up to 5000 Da ) between the cytoplasm and the intermembrane space which represents a reservoir of protons establishing a proton electrochemical gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane that is needed for the production of ATP via ATPase ( complex V ) . 
Intermembrane space contains proapoptotic proteins like cytochrome c , Smac/Diablo , EndoG , and Htra2/Omi . 
In contrast to the permeable outer membrane , the inner mitochondrial membrane , rich in cardiolipin , provides a highly efficient barrier to the flow of small molecules and ions , including protons . 
This membrane is invaginated into numerous cristae increasing cell surface area . 
It houses the respiratory enzymes of the electron transport chain , the cofactor coenzyme Q , and many mitochondrial carriers . 
In the matrix , different metabolic pathways take place including the tricarboxylic or Krebs cycle [ 18 ] .324968 . 
Figure 1 : Representative electromicrographs of mitochondrial ultrastructure . 
Mitochondria are unique amongst cellular organelles in that they have their own , circular , double-stranded DNA ( mtDNA ) which is inherited almost exclusively down the maternal line and codes for 37 mitochondrial genes , 13 of which translate to proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation [ 18 , 19 ] . 
The remaining genes encode transfer ( 22 genes ) and ribosomal ( 2 genes ) RNA allowing the mitochondria to generate their own proteins . 
Although mitochondria have the ability to produce proteins , the vast majority of proteins that function within the mitochondria , including those involved in DNA transcription , translation , and repair , are encoded by nuclear DNA and are transported into the mitochondria from the cytosol . 
As mtDNA is located in the mitochondria in close proximity to the electron transport chain , it is more susceptible to damage from free radicals generated during oxidative phosphorylation [ 20 ] . 
Mitochondria generate energy by two closely coordinated metabolic processes : Krebs cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . 
OXPHOS is made up of the electron transport chain assembled in four enzymes ( complex I to IV ) as well as the F1F0-ATP synthase ( complex V ) . 
Complexes I , III , and IV are located in inner mitochondrial membrane as integral proteins , whereas complex II is attached to the inner surface of this membrane . 
The function of the chain is to generate cellular energy in the form of ATP . 
These five enzymes of the complex are connected functionally by mobile electron acceptors and donors : ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are fed into complexes I and II , respectively . 
Ubiquinone Q carries electrons from both complexes to complex II , and cytochrome c does it from complex III to IV reducing molecular oxygen to water . 
As electrons are transferred along electron transport chain , a fixed number of protons are pumped from the matrix into inner membrane space establishing a electrochemical gradient characterized with a specific electrical potential . 
The redox energy drives the synthesis of ATP from ADP as protons are transported back from inner membrane space into the matrix via complex V. 3 . 
Amyloid-Beta in the Cytosol 
Accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD brains is thought to underlie neuronal dysfunction and memory loss , being centrally implicated in AD pathogenesis . 
Moreover , previous to mitochondrial accumulation of amyloid-beta showed in AD patient and AD transgenic mouse brain , the toxic amyloid-beta species has to be accumulated in the cytosol of the cells . 
Many studies showed amyloid-beta interaction with different receptors in the cellular membrane of the vasculature , neurons , oligodendrocytes , and glial cells where it is transported from cell surface into endosomal and lysosomal compartments [ 21 23 ] . 
The aberrant signalling of these receptors in AD triggered an abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta into cytosol-inducing cellular stress underlies to neuronal dysfunction and dementia . 
It is described by our group and others that these receptors can be megalin , also known as low-density lipoprotein-related protein-2 ( LRP2 ) [ 24 ] , LRP-1 [ 22 ] , or RAGE ( receptors for advanced glycation end products ) [ 25 ] . 
The interaction of these receptors with amyloid-beta in neurons , microglia , and vascular cells accelerates and amplifies deleterious effects on neuronal and synaptic functions . 
These findings are further in line with the recently proposed hypothesis of an intracellular amyloid-beta toxicity cascade which suggests that the toxic amyloid-beta species intervening in molecular and biochemical abnormalities may be intracellular soluble aggregates instead of extracellular , insoluble plaques . 
There are many studies proposing that megalin - and/or RAGE-dependent signalling are involved in the regulation of amyloid-beta clearance and probably may contribute to amyloid pathology and cognitive dysfunction observed in the AD patients and AD mouse model .4 . 
Studies of postmortem brains from AD patients and transgenic mouse models of AD suggest that oxidative damage , induced by amyloid-beta , is associated with mitochondria early in AD progression . 
Amyloid-beta and APP protein are known to localize to mitochondrial membranes , block the transport of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins to mitochondria , interact with mitochondrial proteins , disrupt the electron transport chain , increase reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production , cause mitochondrial damage , and prevent neurons from functioning normally . 
Recent scientific research has identified multiple mechanisms of amyloid-beta interaction with mitochondria at different mitochondrial compartments : the outer mitochondrial membrane , intermembrane space , inner mitochondrial membrane , and the matrix . 
It is well known that the involvement of amyloid-beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis , a vicious cycle as well as several vicious circles within the cycle , each accelerating the other , can be drawn emphasizing the Alzheimer mitochondrial cascade hypothesis . 
The brain is vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to its high lipid content , its relatively high oxygen metabolism , and its low levels of antioxidant defenses [ 26 ] . 
One of the most interesting events in AD is that mitochondrial oxidative stress occurs early in AD progression , before the onset of amyloid-beta pathology [ 27 , 28 ] . 
Oxidative stress was also reported in the mitochondria of other tissues different to the brain such as platelets and fibroblasts from AD patients [ 29 , 30 ] . 
Free radicals ( compounds with an unpaired electron ) or ROS are a normal part of metabolism . 
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS , and , in fact , mitochondrial dysfunction as well as hypometabolism has long been implicated in the onset of the familial and sporadic forms of AD [ 31 ] . 
mtDNA defects have also been linked to an increased incidence of AD [ 32 ] . 
Quantitative morphometric , molecular , and cellular analysis of mitochondria shows increased abnormal and damaged mitochondria in AD [ 33 , 34 ] . 
Energy deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction have been recognized as a prominent , early event in AD . 
Mitochondrial abnormalities have been found both in neurons and astrocytes [ 35 37 ] , suggesting that both neurons and astrocytes might be damaged by free radicals in the AD brain . 
Superoxide radicals might be produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I and III [ 38 ] and in components of the Krebs cycle , including a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase [ 39 ] . 
In addition , superoxide radicals might be generated in the outer mitochondrial membrane . 
H2O2 and superoxide radicals , released from the mitochondrial matrix and from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes , might be carried to the cytoplasm and , ultimately , might lead to the oxidation of cytoplasmic proteins [ 26 ] . 
Several lines of evidence suggest that APP and amyloid-beta are factors contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD ( Figure 2 ) . 
Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for amyloid-beta that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [ 30 ] . 
Multiple lines of evidence support APP and amyloid-beta as contributing factors to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD : both APP and amyloid-beta are present in mitochondrial membrane and interact with mitochondrial proteins , block mitochondrial import channels , impair mitochondrial transport , disrupt the electron transfer chain , increase ROS levels , and cause mitochondrial damage .324968 . 
Figure 2 : APP processing in nondemented healthy individuals and AD patients . 
APP processing occurs by two pathways : a beta-secretase-based amyloidogenic and alpha-secretase-based nonamyloidogenic pathway . 
In the nonamyloidogenic pathway ( left ) , cleavage occurs by alpha-secretase within the amyloid-beta domain and generates the large soluble N-terminal fragment ( sAPP ) and a non-amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acid residues ( C83 ) . 
Further cleavage of this C-terminal fragment by - secretase generates the nonamyloidogenic peptide ( P3 ) and APP intracellular domain ( ACID ) . 
The non-amyloidogenic - secretase pathway occurs in over 90 % of humans , and these individuals generally do not develop dementia . 
In the amyloidogenic pathway ( right ) , cleavage occurs by - secretase at the beginning of the amyloid-beta domain and generates a soluble N-terminus fragment ( sAPP ) and amyloidogenic C-terminal fragment of 99 residues ( C99 ) . 
This C-terminal fragment is further cleaved by

Alzheimer 's Disease-Linked Mutations in Presenilin-1 Result in a Drastic Loss of Activity in Purified - Secretase Complexes

Mutations linked to early onset , familial forms of Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) are found most frequently in PSEN1 , the gene encoding presenilin-1 ( PS1 ) . 
Together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) , the catalytic subunit PS1 constitutes the core of the - secretase complex and contributes to the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) into amyloid-beta ( A ) peptides . 
Although there is a growing consensus that FAD-linked PS1 mutations affect A production by enhancing the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , it remains unclear whether and how they affect the generation of APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) . 
Moreover , controversy exists as to how PS1 mutations exert their effects in different experimental systems , by either increasing A 1 42 production , decreasing A 1 40 production , or both . 
Because it could be explained by the heterogeneity in the composition of - secretase , we purified to homogeneity complexes made of human NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 , and the pathogenic PS1 mutants L166P , E9 , or P436Q . 
We took advantage of a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking PS1 and PS2 to generate different stable cell lines overexpressing human - secretase complexes with different FAD-linked PS1 mutations . 
A multi-step affinity purification procedure was used to isolate semi-purified or highly purified - secretase complexes . 
The functional characterization of these complexes revealed that all PS1 FAD-linked mutations caused a loss of - secretase activity phenotype , in terms of A 1 40 , A 1 42 and APP intracellular domain productions in vitro . 
Our data support the view that PS1 mutations lead to a strong - secretase loss-of-function phenotype and an increased A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio , two mechanisms that are potentially involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer 's disease .

Introduction Top Since their discovery in 1995 and their association with early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease ( FAD ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , the presenilin genes PSEN1 and PSEN2 have been widely studied , and the complexity of their biological role is becoming increasingly evident . 
PSEN1 and PSEN2 encode transmembrane proteins PS1 and PS2 , respectively , that constitute the catalytic core of - secretase , the founding member of an emerging class of unconventional , Intramembrane-Cleaving Proteases ( I-CLiPs ) [ 3 ] . 
Active - secretase is a multiprotein complex composed of PS1 or PS2 together with nicastrin ( NCT ) , the anterior pharynx-defective protein 1 ( APH1 ) , and the presenilin enhancer 2 ( PEN2 ) . 
Experimental evidence such as the binding of transition-state analogue - secretase inhibitors to PS1 [ 4 ] , as well as the abolishment of - secretase activity when PS1 lacks the aspartate residues critical for proteolysis [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , have confirmed that presenilins harbour the active site of the enzymatic complex . 
PS1 and PS2 play fundamental roles in cell signalling as part of the - secretase complex . 
The latter cleaves numerous type-I membrane proteins in their transmembrane domain [ 7 ] , releasing their corresponding intracellular domains , which are capable of influencing gene expression . 
For some substrates like NOTCH1 or ERBB4 , the - secretase cleavage is essential for their biological function , whereas for other substrates like DCC or NEUREXIN-3 [ 8 ] , the possible role of the cleavage in signalling events has not been formally established ( see [ 9 ] for a review ) . 
The amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) is processed by the successive actions of - secretase ( BACE1 ) and - secretase , generating amyloid-beta peptides ( A ) of different lengths , ranging from 37 to 46 amino acids [ 10 ] . 
Cleavage of the APP C-terminal fragments ( APP-CTFs ) by - secretase also releases the APP intracellular domain ( AICD ) , which has been recently involved in the regulation of brain ApoE expression , a major genetic determinant of AD , and in cholesterol metabolism [ 11 ] . 
In addition , PS1 has been shown to interact with a growing list of proteins that modulate - secretase activity [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] . 
In a pathological context , 185 missense mutations in PSEN1 and 13 mutations in PSEN2 have been identified and found to be associated with FAD ( www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations ) . 
It was initially suggested that such mutations lead to a toxic gain of function because they are associated with a relative increased production of longer and more hydrophobic A species , mainly A 1 42 , that accumulate and aggregate early in the course of thedisease [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . 
Similar phenotypes have been observed by independent groups in cell-based studies performed with different mammalian cell lines [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . 
Despite this growing consensus , the above-mentioned studies provided conflicting results regarding the relative proportions of A 42 , A 40 , and AICD resulting from the PSEN mutations . 
On one hand , a gain-of-function phenotype was suggested due to the observed increase in A 42 production , accompanied or not with reduced A 40 production , thereby leading to an increased A 42/A 40 ratio . 
On the other hand , reduced AICD production suggested a loss-of-function phenotype [ 20 ] . 
Differences in the methodologies and cell types used to assess the effects of PSEN mutations on A and AICD productions can explain this controversy as to how PS mutations exert their effects . 
For example , endogenous PS has been suggested to affect such analysis , as the FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations led to a decrease in the total amount of A generated in PS1 and PS2 double knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
Next , it has been reported that - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition ( with two PS genes and three APH1 isoforms , six combinations of - secretase are possible ) , with distinct functional properties influencing the relative amount of A species generated [ 24 ] . 
In order to investigate the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase in cell-free systems , we and others have recently purified this enzymatic complex to homogeneity [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . 
In particular , protocols for the high-grade purification of proteolytically active - secretase constituted of NCT , APH1aL , PEN2 and wild-type PS1 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] allowed the reconstitution of 3D structures at 15 and 12 resolution by EM and cryo-EM and gave new insights on the structure and activity of the enzyme [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] . 
However , these studies were exclusively focused on the wild-type PS1 . 
Here , we report for the first time the functional characterization of highly purified and homogenous human - secretase particles carrying different FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Our biochemical and functional findings strongly suggest that pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 cause a loss of - secretase activity . 
Results Top Generation , selection and characterization of stable cell lines overexpressing - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants 
In order to facilitate high-grade purification of homogenous human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants , we took advantage of a previously generated mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cell line that lacks the two presenilins ( PS1/2 / ) [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . 
Our global strategy consisted in producing stable cell lines , on a PS1/2 / background , that overexpress tagged versions of the three human - secretase subunits NCT , APH1 and PEN2 together with different variants of human PS1 , and to purify the different human - secretase complexes by three sequential affinity purification steps . 
This strategy allowed us to exclude a possible co-purification of mouse - secretase components . 
First , a parental cell line was generated by co-transducing lentiviral vectors of human NCT-V5 ( hNCT-V5 ) , human APH1aL-HA ( hAPH1aL-HA ) and human Flag-PEN2 ( Flag-hPEN2 ) into MEF PS1/2 / . 
Lentivectors are stably integrated into the cell genome and allow the generation of cell lines overexpressing multiple genes in a short period of time . 
Next , the clone expressing the highest levels of all three recombinant proteins was selected ( designated - PS1/2 ) and used as the parental cell line that was further transduced with lentivectors carrying the following different human PS1 variants : PS1-WT , three dominant-negative forms of PS1 that lack the crucial , catalytic site aspartate residues ( D257A , D385A , and both D257A/D385A referred to as DDAA later in the article ) , and three FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 and P436Q , with mean disease onset at 24 years , 45.5 years and 28.3 years , respectively ) . 
For each PS1 variant , two individual clones were selected based on the expression levels of the recombinant proteins , and extensively characterized ( Figure 1 ) . 
To distinguish those cell lines overexpressing all - sectease components from wild-type MEFs , they are collectively designated - MEFs . 
As shown in Figure 1A , the analysis of total protein extracts confirmed that PS is required for the maturation of NCT and the stability of PEN2 [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] . 
As expected , and when compared to the parental - PS1/2 cell line , higher levels of the mature form of NCT were observed in all PS1-overexpressing clones . 
In contrast to PEN2 , APH1aL levels were relatively similar in all PS1 clones and the parental cell line . 
Indeed , and as previously reported [ 23 ] , [ 32 ] , PEN2 levels were higher in the clones overexpressing WT PS1 and FAD-linked PS1 mutants , and to a lesser extent in the clones overexpressing the dominant negative forms of PS1 . 
Interestingly , PEN2 migrated on the gel as an apparent double band , possibly reflecting a post-translational modification . 
Different patterns of PS1 expression and autoproteolysis were observed in the different clones . 
First , and in sharp contrast to the other clones , those expressing PS1-WT or PS1-L166P displayed higher levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments compared with full-length PS1 ( PS1-FL ; Figure 1A ) . 
As estimated by densitometry , the NTF fragments of PS1-WT and PS1-L166P account for 87 2 % and 79 7 % of total PS1 ( PS1-NTF + PS1-FL ) , respectively . 
Next , the PS1 - E9 clones did not show any detectable NTF or CTF fragments , as previously described [ 33 ] , while P436Q and the three dominant negative variants of PS1 were characterized by low levels of PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF fragments , suggesting that these variants were less prone to endoproteolysis . 
Generation of stable cell lines overexpressing all human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
MEF PS1/2 / were stably co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying genes encoding hNCT-V5 , Flag-hPEN2 , hAPH1aL-HA and clones were isolated by limiting dilution to generate a cell line , designated as - PS1/2 , that overexpresses high amount of the three subunits . 
- PS1/2 MEFs were further transduced with hPS1 variants harbouring FAD-linked mutations or mutations in the catalytic aspartate residue ( s ) , or PS1-WT , and cloned . 
Each clone , derived form the - PS1/2 , was conveniently named according to the mutation present in PS1 preceded by the symbol and followed by the number of the clone ( - MEF ) in order to distinguish them from wild-type MEF ( WT MEF ) and MEF PS1/2 / . 
Two clones per - secretase variant were selected for characterization . 
( A B ) Whole cell protein extracts of the different cell lines were prepared in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 4 12 % Bis-Tris or 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining to detect the - secretase core components NCT ( NCT164 ) , PS1 ( NTF , MAB1563 ; CTF ; MAB5232 ) , APH1aL-HA ( 3F10 ) , and Flag-PEN2 ( M2 ) ( A ) , and endogenous APP ( A8717 ) ( B ) . 
- Actin was used as a loading control . 
Each lane represents one selected clone . 
g001 We next investigated the effects of PSEN1 mutations on the processing of endogenous APP . 
As expected , and as indicated by increased levels of intracellular APP-CTFs ( a common characteristic among known substrates in response to - secretase pharmacological inhibition ) , the activity of - secretase was significantly altered in the PS deficient parental - PS1/2 cell line as well as in all clones expressing dominant negative forms of PS1 ( Figure 1B ) . 
In the clones expressing PS1-WT , APP-CTFs were almost undetectable due to high - secretase activity , while clones expressing PS1-L166P or PS1-P436Q displayed APP-CTF accumulation . 
In PS1 - E9 clones , a mild APP-CTF accumulation was observed ( Figure 1B ) . 
Although a poor recovery of - secretase activity for the PS1-L166P and a comparatively better performance of PS1 - E9 have been reported by others under similar experimental conditions [ 23 ] , the potential of PS1-P436Q mutation to restore the processing of endogenous APP-CTFs has never been assessed [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . 
Importantly , all observations described above for the cells overexpressing simultaneously hNCT-V5 , hAPH1aL-HA , Flag-hPEN2 and the different PS1 variants are very consistent with those made in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other - secretase components ( cf. Figure S1A ) . 
These data suggest that the effect of FAD mutations in PS1 on APP-CTFs accumulation was similar in presence or absence of other human components of the - secretase . 
Next , we further investigated the effect of PS1 variants on the cellular production/secretion of A species . 
For this purpose , and as described elsewhere [ 36 ] , we used an APP-based - secretase substrate with a Flag tag at its C-terminus ( SPA4CT-Flag ) . 
This substrate was transduced in the above-described - secretase overexpressing stable cell lines ( - MEFs ) as well as in wild-type MEFs , and APP-CTFs and A levels were measured in cell lysate and cell media , respectively ( Figure 2 ) . 
Under these conditions , the overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag led to an accumulation of two bands corresponding to the exogenous substrate , associated with a concomitant decrease of endogenous APP-CTFs levels ( Figure 2A and Figure S2 ) . 
As estimated by ELISA , a three-fold increase in A 1 40 and A 1 42 levels was observed in the cell culture media of cell lines overexpressing human - secretase ( - MEF WT ) , in comparison to untransduced WT MEFs ( Figure 2B ) . 
Next , overexpression of SPA4CT-Flag in - MEFs led to the pronounced intracellular accumulation of APP-CTFs in cells overexpressing the PS1 aspartate mutants ( Figure 2C ) , and to the secretion in the cell culture media of different A levels as measured by ELISA ( Figure 2D ) . 
First , only traces of both A 1 40 and A 1 42 were detected in - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with aspartate mutants . 
Next , - MEFs overexpressing PS1 with FAD-linked mutations displayed a pronounced variability in A levels when compared to the wild-type clones . 
A production in cell lines overexpressing human - secretase components with FAD-linked PS1 variants . 
WT MEF , - MEF and - PS1/2 were transduced with an APP-based substrate corresponding to the 99 C-terminal residues of human APP fused to the APP signal peptide in N-terminus ( SPA4CT [ 36 ] ) and a Flag Tag in C-terminus . 
Cell proteins were extracted in 1 % NP40-HEPES buffer , separated by SDS-PAGE on 12 % Tris-Glycine gels and analysed by immunostaining with an antibody targeting the C-terminal part of APP ( A8717 ) ( A , C ) . 
Data corresponds to three independent experiments ( Mean SEM ) . 
g002 FAD-linked PS1 mutations alter the activity of semi-purified - secretase complexes 
We next assessed the activity of - secretase with FAD-linked PS1 mutations in microsomal extracts of - MEFs . 
Membrane protein extracts were prepared and - secretase activity was assayed on an exogenous recombinant APP-based substrate consisting of the C-terminal 99 amino acid residues of APP , and referred to as C100-Flag ( Figure 3A ) . 
The generation of the cleavage product AICD-Flag was detected by Western blot analysis and measured by densitometry . 
As shown in Figure 3A , the levels of AICD-Flag generated from the PS1-L166P and PS1 - E9 clones accounted for 42 1 % and 13 6 % of that in the PS1-WT clones , respectively . 
AICD-Flag was undetectable in the clones expressing PS1-P436Q as well as in the three dominant negative aspartate PS1 variants . 
Similar results were observed in MEF PS1/2 / cells overexpressing only the PS1 variants , in the absence of the other human - secretase components ( Figure S1B ) . 
Enzymatic activity of partially purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) - Secretase activity assays performed with - MEF and - PS1/2 microsomal extracts prepared in 1 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer . 
Equal protein levels from the different extracts were diluted to 0.25 % CHAPSO-HEPES buffer and incubated for 4 h at 37 C with lipids and 1 M of recombinant human APP-based substrate ( C100-Flag ) . 
Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-Flag ( M2 ) or anti-PS1 ( MAB1563 ) . 
The relative amounts of AICD-Flag generated in the reactions , reflecting - secretase activity , were estimated by densitometry . 
PS1 immunostaining was used to assess the amount of input material . 
( B ) Equal amounts of microsomal proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 C with either anti-Flag M2 or anti-HA affinity resins , and submitted to a C100-His assay according to the same protocol as in ( A ) . 
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunostaining for - secretase subunits ( ( NCT164 ( NCT ) , MAB1563 ( PS1-NTF ) , or UD1 ( PEN2 ) ) . 
AICD-His cleavage products were immunostained with an anti-APP-CTF antibody ( A8717 ) . 
* Indicates a non-specific band corresponding to the IgG light chains . 
( C ) A 1 40 and A 1 42 were quantified by sandwich ELISA and represented in pg/mL ( left Y-axis ) or in percentage ( right Y-axis ) of the mean of A 1 40 levels generated by the two wild-type clones . 
The results were confirmed in three independent experiments and a representative dataset is shown . 
g003 We next performed activity assays under semi-purified conditions . 
To do so , - secretase complexes from the different clones were co-immunoprecipitated from microsomal extracts and their activities were assayed in vitro with the C100-His substrate . 
Two immunoprecipitation protocols using two affinity resins ( anti-Flag M2 and anti-HA 3F10 , targeting respectively Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA ) were compared to exclude a possible heterogeneity of - secretase complexes potentially generated under such conditions . 
As shown in Figure 3B , the anti-Flag and anti-HA resins immunoprecipitated similar levels of NCT , PS1 and PEN2 and the activity of the - secretase complexes was similar regardless of the affinity resins used ( Figures 3B ) . 
In agreement with the assays performed using microsomal extracts ( Figure 3A ) , those performed with semi-purified complexes revealed that FAD-linked mutants drastically reduced AICD generation , when compared to PS1-WT ( Figure 3B ) . 
Furthermore , levels of A 1 40 produced from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and P436Q variants fell respectively to ~ 6 % , ~ 1.5 % and ~ 0.5 % , when compared to these produced from PS1-WT - secretase . 
Following the same tendency , A 1 42 levels generated from PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 and PS1-P436Q - secretase variants were respectively estimated to ~ 20 % , ~ 5 % and ~ 3 % of these produced with PS1-WT-containing complexes . 
The A 1-42 / A 1 40 ratio measured for WT - MEFs was consistent with our cell-based data ( compare Figures 2D and 3C ) , validating our in vitro experimental conditions . 
Interestingly , an overall A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio of ~ 1 was estimated for all PS1 mutants , with the exception of P436Q # 4 ( ~ 2 ) . 
However , in the latter , the ratio may have been overestimated because the A 1 40 levels measured were at the detection limit . 
This similarity in the A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios generated by the different mutantshas , to the best of our knowledge , never been observed in previous studies . 
Highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants display a loss-of-function phenotype 
In order to further investigate how PS1 variants affect APP-CTF cleavage and to validate our observations performed in semi-purified conditions , we purified to homogeneity - secretase complexes from the selected clones described in Figure 1 . 
The purification process ( described in details under Materials & Methods and depicted in Figure 4A ) involved three sequential affinity purifications starting from microsomal extracts . 
Since all cell lines were generated on a PS knockout background , this strategy allowed us to purify exclusively and selectively - secretase complexes made of human components . 
As highlighted in Figure 4B , our protocol led to the production of stable , high molecular weight - secretase complexes ( HMWCs ) with an apparent molecular mass on Blue Native ( BN ) - PAGE of ~ 350 kDa , which is consistent with previous reports [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 37 ] . 
The silver stained particles on the BN gel confirmed the high purity of these complexes ( Figure 4B , upper panel ) , for which the identity was established by cross-reactivity with antibodies specific to NCT and PS1 ( Figure 4B , lower panels ) . 
As the main goal of this experiment was to compare the efficacy of the different - secretase complexes to process APP-based substrates , it is important to note that the final yields of the complexes purified from the different clones were very similar ( Figure 4B ) , thus facilitating further comparative analyses . 
The immunoblot analysis of the purified complexes ( Figure 4C ) confirmed the presence of all core components ( NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , Flag-PEN2 and PS1 ) and globally recapitulates the maturation processes observed in the Figure 1 . 
Interestingly , the relative PS1-NTF/CTF to PS1-FL ratios in the purified - secretase complexes containing the three PS1 dominant-negative or the PS1-P436Q variants were higher than those estimated in the whole cell extracts before purification ( Figure 1A ) , indicating that endoproteolysis of PS1 was not completely abolished by these mutations . 
To assess how FAD-linked mutations in PS1 affect - secretase activity in these purified complexes , we performed in vitro assays by using C100-Flag substrate ( Figure 3A ) and equal amounts of the different purified complexes , immediately after the purification to avoid freezing/thawing cycles that might affect enzymatic activity . 
As shown in Figure 5A , - secretase activity based on AICD-Flag production was easily detected in complexes purified from the two PS1-WT clones . 
This is in sharp contrast to the other purified complexes that did not generate detectable AICD under our experimental conditions ( Figure 5A ) . 
Next , sandwich ELISAs directed against A 1 40 and A 1 42 were performed in order to further characterize the specific activity of the purified complexes . 
Reflecting the levels of AICD and considering the detection limits of our sandwich ELISA , the production of both A species by - secretase complexes containing PS1-WT was at least 10-fold higher than in complexes with the FAD-linked or dominant-negative PS1 variants ( Figure 5B ) . 
The A 1 42/A 1 40 ratio measured in PS1-WT - secretase complexes ( ~ 0.22 ) was similar to that previously reported [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , thus excluding a possible qualitative alteration of - secretase activity with this protocol . 
Together , our results strongly support the hypothesis that the pathogenic L166P , E9 , and P436Q mutations in PSEN1 cause a drastic loss ( at least 90 % as estimated by ELISA ) of - secretase activity . 
High-grade purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
( A ) Schematic representation of the - secretase purification process . 
Briefly , Presenilin double-knockout MEFs were used to first generate cell lines that stably overexpress human - secretase complexes containing different PS1 variants . 
Next , these cell lines were used for a multi-step purification procedure as described in the material and methods . 
( B ) Blue-Native PAGE analysis of purified - secretase complexes made of different PS1 variants . 
Equal volumes of the different purified - secretase preparations were separated by native-PAGE on a 4 16 % Bis-Tris gel , and stained with silver nitrate ( top panel ) , or immunostained for NCT ( NCT164 , middle panel ) or PS1-NTF ( ab10281 , bottom panel ) as indicated . 
- Secretase complexes appeared on the gel as high molecular weight complexes ( HMWCs ) of ~ 350 kDa . 
Note that the levels of HMWCs were similar for all clones . 
( C ) Equal volumes of purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 mutants were separated under denaturing conditions ( SDS-PAGE ) and immunostained with anti-NCT ( NCT164 ) , anti-PS1-NTF ( MAB1563 ) , anti-PS1-CTF ( MAB5232 ) , anti-HA ( 3F10 ) , or anti-Flag ( M2 ) antibodies . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone with similar results . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
Enzymatic activity of highly purified - secretase complexes with FAD-linked or aspartate PS1 mutants . 
Equal amounts of the different purified - secretase preparations characterized in Figure 4 were tested for activity on C100-Flag , as described in Figure 3 . 
The resulting cleavage products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunostaining with an anti-Flag antibody ( M2 ) for C100-Flag or AICD-Flag ( A ) , and by sandwich ELISA for A 1 40 or A 1 42 ( B ) . 
Note that the levels of A produced from FAD-linked - secretase complexes were all in the non-linear range of the ELISA standards , close to the detection limit . 
Whenever possible , A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios were quantified and indicated on the top of the bars . 
Two independent purifications were performed on each clone and similar results were obtained . 
A representative dataset is shown . 
g005 Discussion Top Several conflicting results as to how Alzheimer 's disease-linked mutations in PSEN1 affect the processing of APP by - secretase have been reported . 
First , it has been previously reported that transgenic animals with FAD-linked PS1 mutations show increasing brain levels of A 1 42 [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Since A 1 42 , the first A specie deposited in the brain of AD patients [ 16 ] , [ 39 ] , is more prone to aggregation when compared to shorter A species [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , it has been implicated in the seeding of amyloid plaques in AD patients with PSEN1 mutations [ 43 ] . 
This was further validated in vivo as the overexpression of PS1 mutants in APP transgenic mice accelerated the rate of A accumulation and deposition in the brain [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] . 
However , Bentahir and colleagues challenged this view by showing that several PSEN1 mutations were also capable to decrease total A production in PS1/PS2 knockout cells [ 23 ] . 
These findings suggested that endogenous PS1 and PS2 may influence the mutant phenotype in cells or in vivo . 
By extension , we hypothesized that the other components of - secretase , namely APH1 , NCT and PEN2 , may influence the mutant phenotype as well . 
Indeed , - secretase complexes are heterogeneous in composition due to the existence of two human APH1 genes , APH1a and APH1b , and two splicing isoforms of APH1a ( S and L ) , as well as two presenilin genes , PSEN1 and PSEN2 . 
Therefore , it is plausible that a single mutation in PSEN1 confers different catalytic properties to distinct - secretase subtypes . 
This hypothesis is supported by recent investigations showing that APH1 variants can modulate A profiles . 
When compared to APH1aS or L , overexpression of APH1b in MEF knockout for all APH1 genes led to increased production of longer A species [ 24 ] . 
With this regard , it is important to note that all four mouse variants of APH1 are expressed in the MEF cell line used in previous studies [ 23 ] and employed here ( cf. Figure S3 ) . 
Since the phenotype of PS1 mutations have mainly been assessed in vivo or in cell-based systems , we investigated the effects of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the processing of APP-CTFs in cell-free systems , by using semi-purified and purified enzymatic complexes isolated from MEF PS1/PS2 double knockout cells stably overexpressing differentially tagged human - secretase components . 
Under these conditions , the biochemical and functional properties of - secretase complexes bearing either FAD-linked PS1 mutants ( L166P , E9 , and P436Q ) , dominant-negative forms of PS1 or wild-type PS1 were characterized . 
The activity of - secretase with PS1-WT was similar to that reported for - secretase purified from our CHO cells overexpressing NCT-V5 , APH1aL , Flag-PEN2 and PS1-WT [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , that resulted in A 1 42/A 1 40 ratios between 0.1 and 0.3 . 
In contrast , we found a major loss in the activity of - secretase complexes containing either the dominant-negative PS1 variants or the FAD-linked PS1 mutants . 
Although a total loss of activity was expected for the dominant negative forms of - secretase [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 32 ] , the drastic loss of activity seen here with the FAD-linked PS1 mutants was unexpected . 
Indeed , the PS1-L166P variant has previously been reported to increase A 1 42 levels both in vivo [ 46 ] and in vitro [ 20 ] , in the presence of endogenous PS1 , PS2 and APH1 components . 
In contrast , Bentahir and colleagues found that PS1-L166P decreased both A 1 40 and A 1 42 production in a PS knockout background . 
These results are consistent with our in vitro data , although the reduction in A 1 42 and A 1 40 production was more pronounced in our system . 
However , they differ from our cell-based data in which we observed an increase in A 1 42 associated with a decrease in A 1 40 . 
Taken together , these data suggest that the overexpression of the other human components of - secretase can influence the phenotype of FAD-linked mutations . 
Another possible explanation for these discrepancies comes from the use , in previously described cellular systems , of APP carrying the Swedish mutation ( K670M/N671L ) [ 20 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 46 ] . 
Initially , this APP variant was shown to enhance the production of all A species by favouring its - secretase cleavage [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] . 
However , Munter and colleagues recently demonstrated that the APP Swedish mutation can also affect the specificity of the - secretase cleavage [ 49 ] . 
In particular , these authors showed that over-expression of APP Swedish in a neuronal cell line led to a 4-fold increase in secreted A 42 , associated with only a 2-fold increase of total A , compared with the wild-type APP . 
Therefore , one can not exclude the possibility of differential interactions between PS1-WT or PS1 variants and different APP variants , as suggested earlier [ 50 ] . 
As far as the PS1 - E9 mutant is concerned , previous cell-based studies have reported a decrease in A 40 levels associated with an increase in A 42 levels [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , or no changes in A 40 levels despite increased A 42 levels [ 53 ] , or a decrease in both A species [ 23 ] . 
In the present study , A 1 40 , A 1 42 , as well as AICD levels generated from purified - secretase complexes with PS1 - E9 were close to the limit of detection , resulting in a loss of at least 95 % of the - secretase activity compared to wild-type PS1 . 
Similarly , we found a near to complete loss of - secretase activity for complexes with the aggressive PS1-P436Q mutant ( mean onset : 28.3 years ) [ 54 ] . 
Consistent with a recent study [ 35 ] , and in contrast to PS1-L166P , the maturation of the full-length PS1-P436Q protein into PS1-NTF and PS1-CTF was impaired . 
Interestingly , the same study also reported that P436Q variant showed a decreased - secretase activity and A 40 and A 42 secretion in PS1/PS2 double knockout cells ( ~ 75 % or ~ 50 % of the control for A 40 or A 42 , respectively ) , but to a lesser extent than what we measured in this study ( more than 97 % for both A species ) . 
Overall , our data show that , under our experimental conditions , the FAD-linked PS1 mutants cause a drastic loss of activity ( at least 90 % ) in the highly purified and homogeneous as well as semi-purified - secretase complexes . 
This loss-of-function is asymmetrical as A 1 42 levels were relatively less affected than A 1 40 levels . 
Interestingly , the ratio between the two A species was similar for the variants tested here ( ~ 1 ) , suggesting a common modulatory mechanism . 
Our findings further support a model in which the subtype of - secretase containing APH1aL and FAD-linked PS1 mutants generates a higher A 42/A 40 ratio compared to PS1-WT , as previously observed in vivo [ 15 ] , [ 38 ] . 
Taken together , the overall reduction in A levels strongly suggest that other regulatory mechanisms or cellular components may exist and account for the strong amyloid pathology observed in AD patients carrying these FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations . 
In agreement with this hypothesis , we report that the phenotype of FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations is different whether we consider the cell-based or the cell-free conditions . 
Indeed , even if A 42/A 40 ratios were globally increased in both experimental conditions , A production was strikingly different . 
One possible explanation would be that specific subtypes of - secretase complexes are less affected than others by PSEN1 mutations . 
For instance , it remains unknown whether - secretase complexes carrying APH1b or APH1aS are similarly affected by PSEN1 mutations . 
In support to that regard , Winkler and colleagues recently purified human - secretase with PS1-L166P and observed that such complexes , containing both APH1a and AHP1b , led to increased A 1 42 production associated with decreased A 1 40 production , as compared to the PS1-WT complexes . 
Another possible explanation would be that purified - secretase complexes lack binding partners modulating the processing of APP-based substrates , due to purification conditions affecting physical interactions of proteins . 
These include TMP21 or the recently reported - secretase activating protein ( GSAP ) [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . 
Further biochemical analyses are needed to test this hypothesis . 
The loss of activity in - secretase containing PS1 variants also leads to decreased generation of AICD . 
As AICD is involved in the transcriptional regulation of several genes , including the neprilysin [ 55 ] , and the lipoprotein receptor , LRP1 [ 11 ] , it is likely that mutations in PSEN1 impair the regulation of these genes in vivo . 
For instance , it is possible that unknown genes transcriptionally regulated in vivo by the AICD might influence A metabolism in return . 
In support to these views , Veeraraghavalu and colleagues recently demonstrated that Notch signalling was impaired in transgenic mice overexpressing PS1 mutants , albeit in the presence of endogenous PS1-WT and all APH1 isoforms [ 56 ] . 
They found decreased self-renewal and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells in the subventricular zone , suggesting that the loss-of-function phenotype of PSEN1 mutations can also be observed in heterogeneous conditions . 
These results are reminiscent of the previous report from Saura and colleagues showing that conditional inactivation of both presenilins in vivo induces age-dependent neurodegeneration associated with memory impairment [ 57 ] . 
Altogether , the above-described data suggest that alternative pathways of neurodegeneration related to loss of - secretase functions are possible and relevant to AD . 
They further support the concept that modulating rather than inhibiting - secretase activity would be a more appropriate therapeutic strategy for AD [ 58 ] . 
Supporting this view , the - secretase inhibitor Semagacestat tested in phase III clinical trials not only failed to slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD , but actually made it worse [ 59 ] . 
Collectively , our findings support a model in which FAD-linked mutations in PSEN1 likely induce A pathology by perturbing the relative ratio between A species and by impairing developmental and cellular signalling pathways controlled by - secretase substrates . 
This deleterious dual effect might explain why FAD-linked PSEN1 mutations cause early onset Alzheimer 's disease . 
Since it has been established that A and AICD are generated following the processing by - secretase at two distinct gamma - and epsilon-cleavage sites in APP [ 60 ] , further investigation is now required to better understand whether and how FAD mutations in PS1 differentially affect the epsilon versus gamma-cleavage sites in APP , as well as in other known - secretase substrates . 
Materials and Methods Top DNA Constructs and mutagenesisNCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 , APH1aL-HA , wild-type PS1 human cDNAs ( PS1-WT ) were obtained from D. Selkoe ( Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston , MA , USA ) . 
PS1 E9 cDNA was obtained from C. Saura ( Universitat Aut noma de Barcelona , Spain ) . 
PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A cDNAs were obtained from M. Wolfe ( Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital , Boston , MA , USA ) . 
The sequences corresponding to enzyme restriction sites are given in small letters . 
The PCR fragments were next digested with BamHI/HindIII and HindIII/XhoI respectively , and were subcloned into pcDNA3 . 
PS1 D257A/D385A ( DDAA ) was obtained by subcloning the DraI/XhoI digested fragment of PS1 D385A into pcDNA3.1-PS1 D257A . 
All constructs were next subcloned into the self-inactivated vector pSIN-PGK-WHV cassette ( a kind gift from R. Zufferey , Brain Mind Institute , EPFL , Lausanne , Switzerland ) . 
Inserts for plasmids pET21-C100-Flag , and pET21-C100-His were generated by PCR as previously described [ 27 ] . 
Plasmids pMD2G and psPAX2 were obtained from D. Trono ( Global Health Institute , EPFL , Lausanne , Switzerland ) . 
Replication-defective lentiviral particles were produced by a three-plasmid transient transfection of cells from the human embryonic kidney HEK 293T cell line [ 61 ] . 
Briefly , cells were incubated in 10 cm dishes until they reached 70 % confluence and were transiently co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method , with 5 g of envelope plasmid ( pMD2G ) , 15 g of packaging plasmid ( psPAX2 ) , and 20 g of vector plasmids ( pSIN-PGK-WHV ) . 
Cells were incubated overnight with DNA-calcium precipitates , washed twice with Dulbecco 's modified Eagle 's medium ( DMEM , Invitrogen ) and incubated with 7 mL of DMEM . 
After 24 h , the conditioned medium was harvested and cells were incubated a second time with 7 mL of DMEM for 24 h. Media were then pooled , passed through 0.45 m filter , and stored at 80 C as 2 mL aliquots until use . 
A p24 ELISA ( Zeptometrix corporation ) was performed on each batch of media in order to evaluate the number of viral particles generated . 
Generation of stable cell lines through multiple gene transductions 
Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs , obtained from B. De Strooper , Flanders University Institute of Biotechnology , Belgium ) defective in PSEN1 and PSEN2 [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] were cultivated in 10 cm dishes in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( P/S ) ( Invitrogen ) . 
A first set of stable cell lines was generated by co-transducing NCT-V5 , APH1aL-HA , and Flag-PEN2 containing lentiviral vectors ( LV ) repeatedly for two weeks at each passage ( 1/20 ) . 
Ten clones were isolated by the limiting dilution method and were further screened for NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 and APH1aL-HA expression by immunodetection . 
The clone that showed the highest expression of the three proteins ( designated - PS1/2 ) was used as the parental cell line to generate the stable cell lines expressing different PS1 variants , by the same method and by using lentiviral vectors carrying human PS1-WT , PS1-L166P , PS1 - E9 , PS1-P436Q , PS1-D257A , PS1-D385A , and PS1-DDAA . 
For each PS1 variant , five clones were selected for a full characterization and two of them were further used for - secretase purification . 
For SPA4CT overexpression experiments , 500,000 cells of each clone were exposed to the same arbitrary dose of lentiviral vectors carrying human SPA4CT-Flag in 2 mL of DMEM , 1 % FBS , P/S and were plated in 6-wells plates for 72 h. The medium was next replaced by fresh DMEM , 2 % FBS , P/S for 24 h. Finally , cell culture medium was harvested , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , centrifuged for 3 min at 1,000 rpm and frozen at 80 C until further processing . 
Cells were washed in PBS and submitted to protein extraction . 
Total protein extracts were prepared in 1 % NP40 - HEPES buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) , and were clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 16,000 g , 4 C. Cell membranes were obtained as described below and solubilised in 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 1 h. Supernatants corresponding to the microsomal protein extracts were harvested and stored at 80 C. Protein content of the extracts was estimated by the BCA protein assay reagent kit ( Pierce ) . 
Multi-step purification of human - secretase complexes with FAD-linked PS1 variants1 ) Cell membrane preparation . 
MEF PS1/PS2 DKO cells ( 1.0 109 cells ) expressing NCT-V5 , Flag-PEN2 , APH1aL-HA and different forms of PS1 : wild type ( WT ) , or with FAD-linked variants or lacking the critical aspartate residues , were collected from 15 cm dishes and fully resuspended in 40 mL of MES buffer ( 50 mM MES , pH 6.0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 5 mM CaCl2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . 
Next , cells were passed four times through a high-pressure homogenizer ( Emulsiflex-C5 , Avestin Inc , ON Canada ) at a pressure greater than 1,000 psi . 
Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 20 min at 4 C in a Beckman Coulter Allegra X-15R centrifuge . 
The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C in a SW32 
Ti rotor using a Beckman Coulter Optima L-80 ultracentrifuge to recover the membrane preparation in the pellet . 
The membrane pellet was fully resuspended in 1.6 mL of ice cold sodium bicarbonate buffer ( 0.1 M NaHCO3 , pH 11.3 ) by pipetting up and down at least 30 times , and incubated at 4 C for 20 min . 
The washed membranes were then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 C and stored at 80 C until use . 
3 ) Solubilisation of - secretase complexes . 
The bicarbonate-washed membranes were fully resuspended in 1.7 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer by pipetting up and down at least 30 times . 
The membranes were then incubated at 4 C for 1 h. To pellet the insoluble material , the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4 C for 1 h , the pellet was discarded , and the supernatant saved . 
This lysate is defined as solubilised - secretase preparation . 
Next , these freshly prepared solubilised preparations were used for affinity purification of - secretase complexes as described below . 
4 ) Anti-Flag M2 affinity purification . 
The solubilised - secretase preparations were first diluted 1:2 with HEPES buffer , and further diluted 1:6 with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7.4 , 150 mM NaCl ) ( final detergent concentration : 0.08 % CHAPSO , 0.08 % digitonin ) and incubated overnight at 4 C with agitation after adding 200 L of anti-Flag M2 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) that had been pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted over 4 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of Flag peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once for 1 h at 4 C and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated M2 pooled 800 L fractions . 
5 ) Anti-V5 affinity purification . 
The M2 pooled fractions ( volume made up to 1 mL with 0.1 % Digitonin - TBS buffer ) were next incubated overnight at 4 C under agitation with 200 L of anti-V5 affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % digitonin-TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted for 1 h at 4 C with 0.4 mL of this buffer containing 500 g/mL of V5 peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated 4 times , and the eluted fractions were pooled and designated V5 pooled 1.6 mL fractions . 
As a final purification step , the V5 pooled fractions ( volume made up to 1.8 mL with 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer ) were next incubated overnight at 4 C under agitation with 200 L of anti-HA affinity resin beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , pre-equilibrated in 0.1 % digitonin - TBS buffer . 
The beads were washed 3 times in the same buffer , and the bound proteins were eluted overnight at 4 C with 0.2 mL of this buffer containing 200 g/mL of HA peptides ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . 
This elution step was repeated once , for 1 h at 4 C , and the two eluted fractions were kept separately , designated HA fraction E1 and HA fraction E2 . 
Co-IPs were performed on microsomal protein extracts . 
Briefly , 100 g of proteins were diluted in a final volume of 1 mL of 1 % CHAPSO - HEPES extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors ( Roche ) , and 50 L of pre-equilibrated anti-Flag or anti-HA affinity beads ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added . 
Samples were next incubated overnight at 4 C on a rotator wheel and were washed three times in 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer . 
Finally , beads were resuspended in 50 L of 0.2 % CHAPSO - HEPES buffer and were used for in vitro - secretase assays . 
In vitro - secretase activity assays
